breaking news

2
00:00:05,199 --> 00:00:07,479
five time MBA
champion Kobe Bryant

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,520
died in helicopter crash

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:15,221
a high profile aviation
accident devastates Los Angeles

5
00:00:17,905 --> 00:00:20,905
NTSB investigators
quickly inspect the wreckage

6
00:00:21,222 --> 00:00:23,222
all the mechanical systems
electronic systems

7
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:25,419
appeared to be working fine

8
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:29,039
the data provides a detail
picture of the entire flight

9
00:00:29,098 --> 00:00:32,620
so they get airborne just after 9:00
and then again held up for 12 minutes

10
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:34,301
November 2 echo x-ray

11
00:00:35,023 --> 00:00:36,523
hold at site
Burbank airspace

12
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:38,259
okay we'll hold at site
Burbank

13
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,564
certainly this added
to the time of the flight

14
00:00:41,644 --> 00:00:44,144
he's bombing along
here about 140 knots

15
00:00:45,307 --> 00:00:48,100
investigators must
consider the unthinkable

16
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,760
was he trying to make
up for the last time?

17
00:00:50,802 --> 00:00:53,002
a lot of people wonder if
Kobe being Kobe might have

18
00:00:53,064 --> 00:00:54,797
put pressure on this pilot

19
00:00:54,885 --> 00:00:57,100
but there is no evidence
to support that suspicion

20
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,980
so what happened to this guy?

21
00:01:26,022 --> 00:01:27,022
hey rick

22
00:01:28,544 --> 00:01:30,624
I'm gonna go straight
north to Dodger Stadium

23
00:01:30,785 --> 00:01:31,785
around Burbank

24
00:01:32,218 --> 00:01:34,759
and follow the 118 to get up
and around the weather down here

25
00:01:35,341 --> 00:01:37,421
what's visibility
of Burbank?

26
00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:39,426
broken clouds with
5 miles of visibility

27
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,460
we're good to go

28
00:01:41,463 --> 00:01:45,544
Ara Zobayan is a helicopter pilot
with more than 8000 flying hours

29
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:47,806
they'll be here about 15 minutes

30
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:48,860
I'll meet them here

31
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,287
and help them get loaded
roger that

32
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:52,361
he is the chief pilot
for Island Express

33
00:01:52,622 --> 00:01:56,605
helicopter charter company based
in California Los Angeles county

34
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,519
Island Express is a
family owned company

35
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,628
that's been in southern
California for a number of decades

36
00:02:02,662 --> 00:02:06,762
and they're known as a company
that can provide VIP helicopter service

37
00:02:07,981 --> 00:02:10,781
amongst their high
profile regular customers

38
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,320
media star kyle Jenner

39
00:02:12,821 --> 00:02:15,321
LA Clipper's superstar
Kawhi Leonard

40
00:02:15,942 --> 00:02:16,942
and today's client

41
00:02:17,384 --> 00:02:19,384
LA Lakers great Kobe Bryant

42
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,020
Kobe Bryant was one of the
best basketball players of all time

43
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,340
he is an iconic
Los Angeles Laker

44
00:02:26,421 --> 00:02:29,859
he was drafted by the team in
1996 when he was 17 years old

45
00:02:30,341 --> 00:02:32,859
he became a heart and
soul of the team for 20 years

46
00:02:32,899 --> 00:02:34,699
he won five world
championships

47
00:02:34,735 --> 00:02:36,835
he went to the all
star game 18 times

48
00:02:37,001 --> 00:02:38,001
and really

49
00:02:38,001 --> 00:02:41,101
just became a huge star in
his own right apart from the team

50
00:02:41,104 --> 00:02:43,722
and that he was recognized
simply by his first name Kobe

51
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,340
how is everyone doing today?

52
00:02:47,342 --> 00:02:50,483
Ara Zobayan has flown Kobe
and his family dozens of times

53
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:52,304
let's get going

54
00:02:53,866 --> 00:02:56,766
Kobe and the pilot of this
helicopter really become friends

55
00:02:56,948 --> 00:03:01,148
because he had piloted him so many
times around southern California that

56
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,460
they developed the relationship

57
00:03:03,742 --> 00:03:07,322
Kobe Bryant flies in
luxury Sikorsky S-76B

58
00:03:08,223 --> 00:03:10,623
it's configured to
carry 8 passengers

59
00:03:11,064 --> 00:03:14,919
the Sikorsky S-76B is
sort of like an air limousine

60
00:03:15,259 --> 00:03:17,759
and that is quite
common for VIP travel

61
00:03:17,782 --> 00:03:20,583
I think heads of state
use it in different countries

62
00:03:20,864 --> 00:03:24,261
and it also uses sort of air
ambulance in some situations

63
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,380
spacious and reliable

64
00:03:26,782 --> 00:03:29,344
it really considered
about safe as they come

65
00:03:31,305 --> 00:03:32,905
Kobe
his daughter Gianna

66
00:03:33,306 --> 00:03:36,306
and six others are headed to a
basketball tournament near Camarillo

67
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,480
18 miles away

68
00:03:40,062 --> 00:03:41,562
Kobe is the team's coach

69
00:03:42,303 --> 00:03:43,803
Gianna
the star player

70
00:03:45,665 --> 00:03:49,865
today's 13 minute flight will take
the helicopter north passed Burbank

71
00:03:50,061 --> 00:03:52,061
and then west
towards Camarillo

72
00:03:52,623 --> 00:03:55,164
Zobayan will follow two
highways for guidance

73
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,020
the five
north west

74
00:03:57,741 --> 00:03:59,741
and the 101
west to Camarillo

75
00:04:01,703 --> 00:04:04,343
hey everyone it's about
to get loud back there

76
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,920
copter 72 echo x-ray

77
00:04:11,983 --> 00:04:13,983
I express for island departure

78
00:04:14,258 --> 00:04:15,758
helicopter 72
echo x-ray

79
00:04:16,221 --> 00:04:18,221
clear for departure
from island express

80
00:04:18,501 --> 00:04:19,941
have a good flight

81
00:04:19,999 --> 00:04:21,699
good flight to echo x-ray

82
00:04:22,422 --> 00:04:23,422
just after 9:00AM

83
00:04:24,142 --> 00:04:26,242
the helicopter lifts
off from Santa Ana

84
00:04:29,506 --> 00:04:32,706
the destination is Kobe
Bryant's Mamba Sport Academy

85
00:04:33,981 --> 00:04:35,981
it's a regular
journey for Zobayan

86
00:04:36,263 --> 00:04:39,144
he flew the same group
there a back yesterday

87
00:04:40,499 --> 00:04:42,499
he was a very experienced pilot

88
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:47,339
he was able to fly the
helicopter at speed at low altitude

89
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,946
in a very dense airspace and
deal with weather at the same time

90
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,440
since his early days as a player, Kobe
Bryant has preferred helicopter travel

91
00:04:57,604 --> 00:04:59,864
to the crowded freeways
of southern California

92
00:05:01,179 --> 00:05:04,824
he routinely uses helicopters for
his personal and professional travel

93
00:05:06,062 --> 00:05:10,562
Kobe loved to fly by helicopter just
because he loved how much time it saved him

94
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:13,719
Kurt Deetz also flew
for island express

95
00:05:14,822 --> 00:05:17,422
flying in LA is
like no where else

96
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:23,309
there is a large congestion
of multiple type of airspace

97
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:25,919
in small area

98
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:29,040
so you always in
and out of airspace

99
00:05:30,021 --> 00:05:31,021
today's flight

100
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,444
will first need to past through the
control airspace surrounding Burbank

101
00:05:35,538 --> 00:05:37,038
and then Van Nuys

102
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:41,080
Burbank, helicopter 72
echo x-ray Sikorsky helicopter

103
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:44,683
approaching the zone for
a 101 westbound transition

104
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,184
Zobayan requests permission to
past through Burbank airspace

105
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,723
it's a very busy airport

106
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:52,485
and the controllers

107
00:05:52,579 --> 00:05:54,340
they don't know
what they're doing

108
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,580
November 72 echo x-ray
Burbank tower

109
00:05:56,862 --> 00:05:58,662
Burbank class charlie is IFR
say intentions

110
00:06:00,498 --> 00:06:03,198
Burbank is only
accepting IFR flights

111
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,260
or instrument flight rules

112
00:06:05,462 --> 00:06:08,143
which requires pilot to
navigate solely on instruments

113
00:06:09,618 --> 00:06:14,902
Zobayan however is only authorized
to fly using visual flight rules (VFR)

114
00:06:16,338 --> 00:06:18,939
the threshold for the visual
flight is normally 3 miles

115
00:06:19,702 --> 00:06:21,902
the Burbank airport
was 2.5 miles

116
00:06:23,664 --> 00:06:25,864
within sufficient
visibility for VFR

117
00:06:26,346 --> 00:06:28,546
the controller
denies his request

118
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:33,422
but zobayan has been flying helicopter
in southern California long enough

119
00:06:33,504 --> 00:06:35,504
to know a way
around this restriction

120
00:06:35,866 --> 00:06:39,066
asking for special VFR
transition to the 101 westbound

121
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:45,465
special VFR allows him to operate
at lower than standard visibilities

122
00:06:46,548 --> 00:06:48,548
down to 1 mile of visibility

123
00:06:50,502 --> 00:06:53,702
and that's an agreement
you have with the tower saying

124
00:06:53,784 --> 00:06:54,784
I'm here

125
00:06:54,945 --> 00:06:56,225
I wanna go there

126
00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:58,659
I'm requesting a special VFR

127
00:06:58,941 --> 00:07:03,963
special VFR allows zobayan to navigate
visually through the area of low visibility

128
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,260
November 2 echo x-ray

129
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:09,394
hold outside Burbank airspace

130
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:12,162
I have an aircraft going
around in an inbound citation

131
00:07:12,504 --> 00:07:16,261
the controller authorizes zobayan
to cross into Burbank airspace

132
00:07:17,021 --> 00:07:19,021
but under the
rules of special VFR

133
00:07:19,303 --> 00:07:22,946
he must now wait until the
airspace is clear of traffic

134
00:07:23,546 --> 00:07:25,546
okay we'll hold outside Burbank
2 echo x-ray

135
00:07:27,702 --> 00:07:28,742
hey everyone

136
00:07:28,762 --> 00:07:30,495
we'll have to circle
here for a few minutes

137
00:07:30,702 --> 00:07:32,845
while we wait for a few
planes to get out our way

138
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:34,539
it shouldn't delay too much

139
00:07:36,342 --> 00:07:37,842
anytime you have a hold

140
00:07:41,665 --> 00:07:42,665
because you mean late

141
00:07:48,379 --> 00:07:50,979
finally after holding
for 12 minutes

142
00:07:51,502 --> 00:07:53,302
the Burbank airspace clears

143
00:07:53,503 --> 00:07:55,503
and zobayan is
allowed to pass through

144
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,059
November 2 echo x-ray

145
00:07:57,501 --> 00:07:59,601

we'll maintain special VFR

148
00:08:05,306 --> 00:08:06,306
from Burbank

149
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,141
the helicopter will follow
the I-5 freeway northwest

150
00:08:09,981 --> 00:08:13,621
and the 118 around the
the top of Van Nuys airspace

151
00:08:13,941 --> 00:08:17,041
the south to follow
the 101 to Camarillo

152
00:08:24,619 --> 00:08:28,519
Kobe Bryant and the other passengers
are anticipated to arrive in Camarillo

153
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:30,809
just a few minutes
behind schedule

154
00:08:32,225 --> 00:08:34,825
Van Nuys
helicopter 2 echo x-ray with you

155
00:08:34,868 --> 00:08:36,868

helicopter 72 echo x-ray

157
00:08:39,422 --> 00:08:42,322
cleared into Van Nuys along
the 118 freeway westbound

158
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:47,819
the helicopter is clear to pass
through the airspace near Van Nuys

159
00:08:50,141 --> 00:08:53,864
zobayan now dials in the
final controller for this journey

160
00:08:54,379 --> 00:08:57,460
the southern California
radar approach controller

161
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,122
who will handle the flight
until it reaches Camarillo

162
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:04,099
helicopter 72 echo x-ray
with you at 570 to Camarillo

Southern California approach

164
00:09:08,262 --> 00:09:11,163
roger, are you just gonna stay down
that low all the way to Camarillo?

165
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:16,140
the helicopter is flying
570 feet above the ground

166
00:09:17,221 --> 00:09:19,221
yes sir, low altitude
2 echo x-ray

167
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,820
zobayan needs to
stay bellow the clouds

168
00:09:22,822 --> 00:09:25,343
which are around 1000
feet above the ground

169
00:09:26,507 --> 00:09:27,507
when he went

170
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:30,599
was a lowest amount available

171
00:09:31,261 --> 00:09:32,261
because of the weather

172
00:09:32,982 --> 00:09:35,623
roger, I'm gonna use
radar with you surely

173
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:39,259
but at the low
altitude in hilly terrain

174
00:09:39,421 --> 00:09:42,543
controllers won't be able to
maintain radar contact with the flight

175
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:47,520
the controllers will not
see him on radar you so low

176
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,220
copy that
2 echo x-ray

177
00:10:02,463 --> 00:10:04,988
less than 10 minutes
from his destination

178
00:10:05,299 --> 00:10:06,899
the visibility gets worse

179
00:10:08,061 --> 00:10:10,461
in the Lose Angeles basin area

180
00:10:10,542 --> 00:10:13,242
it's well known to get
the supreme layer of

181
00:10:13,388 --> 00:10:15,639
colder water,
temperatures, warmer air

182
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,562
where you get these low
clouds and you get lower visibility

183
00:10:20,461 --> 00:10:24,703
zobayan radio is in his intention
to climb above some low clouds

184
00:10:26,665 --> 00:10:29,370
we're gonna go ahead start
our climb to go above the layers

185
00:10:38,741 --> 00:10:40,941
2 echo x-ray
where are you?

186
00:10:42,562 --> 00:10:44,562
just west of Van Nuys
2 echo x-ray

187
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,180
2 echo x-ray
ident

188
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,982
the controller hasn't been
tracking the helicopter

189
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,261
he needs zobayan to
flash his transponder signals

190
00:10:54,582 --> 00:10:56,582
so he can located on his screen

191
00:10:57,024 --> 00:10:59,524
you press the button
of transponder that

192
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:01,679
flashes on their radar screen

193
00:11:02,222 --> 00:11:03,655
so they know where you are

194
00:11:03,662 --> 00:11:04,662
ident

195
00:11:09,261 --> 00:11:11,328
2 echo x-ray
say intentions

196
00:11:12,061 --> 00:11:14,561
we're climbing to 4000
2 echo x-ray

197
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:19,500
and what are you gonna
do when you reach altitude?

198
00:11:36,592 --> 00:11:38,592
in the hills near Calabasas

199
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,105
witnesses see a helicopter
emerge from the clouds

200
00:11:41,665 --> 00:11:42,665
and hit the ground

201
00:11:50,824 --> 00:11:52,824
the team tracking
Kobe Bryant's flight

202
00:11:53,302 --> 00:11:55,302
realizes something's going wrong

203
00:11:55,704 --> 00:11:58,744
the helicopter should have
landed at Camarillo by now

204
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,129
it's disappeared
from their flight tracker

205
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:04,779
we have some breaking news

206
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:08,420
a helicopter crash in southern
California Lose Angeles county

207
00:12:08,463 --> 00:12:11,263
sheriff's deputies responding
to reports of that crash

208
00:12:11,301 --> 00:12:13,701
just before 10:00
am pacific time

209
00:12:13,862 --> 00:12:15,962
it's located in the
Calabasas area

210
00:12:16,143 --> 00:12:20,143
it doesn't take long before the
media is reporting the tragic news

211
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,880
Kobe Bryant
his 13 year old daughter

212
00:12:24,023 --> 00:12:25,523
along with 7 other people

213
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:28,503
have been killed in
the helicopter crash

214
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,600
it's just one of those things
where you can read the words and

215
00:12:32,703 --> 00:12:35,503
you kind of process
them but you don't really

216
00:12:35,544 --> 00:12:39,144
it's hard for thinking because
you've got to think about

217
00:12:39,221 --> 00:12:41,221
that he's never coming back

218
00:12:41,782 --> 00:12:43,782
he was the guy, he was
my icon, my role model

219
00:12:44,419 --> 00:12:46,419
who got me into this world
who got me playing

220
00:12:50,835 --> 00:12:53,235
you won't see another
player like him again

221
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,820
this what we missed

222
00:12:55,262 --> 00:12:58,904
there is this tremendous
outpouring of grief in Lose Angeles

223
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:01,478
people flock the staple center

224
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,620
left all different
kinds of mementos

225
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,663
this is much bigger
than basketball I think

226
00:13:08,181 --> 00:13:09,181
just because

227
00:13:09,621 --> 00:13:12,961
I think Kobe was a real symbol
you know of just hard work, dedication

228
00:13:13,824 --> 00:13:17,126
everybody was really just
heartsick by what happened

229
00:13:17,507 --> 00:13:20,107
love you Kobe, love you
Gigi, and all the family

230
00:13:25,059 --> 00:13:27,759
we're here to conduct
a safety investigation

231
00:13:29,301 --> 00:13:33,201
and our mission is not to
just determine what happened

232
00:13:33,201 --> 00:13:35,222
but why it happened
and how it happened

233
00:13:36,027 --> 00:13:39,221
to prevent a similar accident
from ever happening again

234
00:13:41,103 --> 00:13:44,103
the NTSB begins its
investigation at the crash site

235
00:13:45,018 --> 00:13:48,618
looking for any clues to explain
why a state of the art helicopter

236
00:13:49,101 --> 00:13:51,601
being flown by highly
experienced pilot

237
00:13:51,944 --> 00:13:55,040
crashed 24 miles
short of its destination

238
00:13:56,701 --> 00:13:58,401
the first think you
do with the crash site

239
00:13:58,482 --> 00:14:01,580
is try to see that all the
components make it to the crash site

240
00:14:02,661 --> 00:14:05,161
was there any kind
of mechanical failure

241
00:14:05,183 --> 00:14:07,419
did a rotor blade break
or tail rotor come off

242
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:14,181
the team uses a drone to scan the accident
site and study the shape of the debris

243
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,420
look at this accident site

244
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:17,523
is very clear

245
00:14:17,542 --> 00:14:19,663
this was a relatively
high rate of descent

246
00:14:20,104 --> 00:14:21,104
the helicopter pit

247
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,660
and the wreckage then bounced
about 90 feet where came to rest

248
00:14:26,384 --> 00:14:29,084
so there is a lot more
vertical speed here

249
00:14:29,181 --> 00:14:31,181
than you have horizontal speed

250
00:14:31,701 --> 00:14:34,722
and all the parts of helicopter
made it to the accident site

251
00:14:39,822 --> 00:14:42,322
investigator study
flight control surfaces

252
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,425
the engines and rotors

253
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:46,679
as well as the helicopter's
flight instruments

254
00:14:48,219 --> 00:14:53,319
examinations components found that there
was no evidence of any pre impact failures

255
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,300
that all the mechanical
system, electronic systems

256
00:14:56,302 --> 00:14:58,902
everything at that time
appeared to be working fine

257
00:15:01,581 --> 00:15:04,981
the NTSB's Bill English
has led investigation

258
00:15:04,984 --> 00:15:08,296
into some of the world's most
notorious aviation accidents

259
00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:10,879
we need to cover all
our bases on this one

260
00:15:11,741 --> 00:15:14,441
knowing there is a high
profile person on board

261
00:15:14,463 --> 00:15:17,538
obviously NTSB responded
with a major investigation team

262
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,980
okay

263
00:15:20,101 --> 00:15:22,601
he takes off at 9:07
he flies north west

264
00:15:24,061 --> 00:15:26,002
to better understand
what happened

265
00:15:26,061 --> 00:15:30,361
investigators piece together a
detailed flight path from an ADS B system

266
00:15:30,579 --> 00:15:32,879
that's on board the
Sikorsky helicopter

267
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:37,779
ADS B data is like
transponder data

268
00:15:38,982 --> 00:15:41,082
controllers can
see these recorded

269
00:15:41,227 --> 00:15:44,827
your airspeed, altitude and
heading, other information

270
00:15:45,421 --> 00:15:47,921
and so you have
this plotting capability

271
00:15:48,262 --> 00:15:51,360
look like there is some
kind of hold here at Burbank

272
00:15:51,619 --> 00:15:53,619
he follows the i5 to Van Nuys

273
00:15:54,738 --> 00:15:58,422
south to the 101 which he
follows until he makes this U turn

274
00:15:58,822 --> 00:15:59,822
straight into a hell site

275
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:02,379
you'd see this turn to left

276
00:16:02,778 --> 00:16:05,278
where he's coming back
around or doing something

277
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:08,620
and that question is
now in the investigation

278
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:10,703
what is exactly the
pilot doing here?

279
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,740
let's take a look at visibility

280
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:18,202
they study visibility reports from
weather station along the route

281
00:16:19,659 --> 00:16:21,659
he did manage to
avoid the worst of it here

282
00:16:21,661 --> 00:16:24,361
but socked in the
Burbank and Van Nuys

283
00:16:24,503 --> 00:16:26,503
but nothing he can't get through

284
00:16:28,741 --> 00:16:30,541
4 mile of visibility

285
00:16:30,742 --> 00:16:34,539
when he got near the Burbank
air port, it's 2.5 miles of visibility

286
00:16:34,659 --> 00:16:36,459
that still totally flyable for him

287
00:16:36,661 --> 00:16:38,961
in fact by his
operation specifications

288
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:41,239
he could go down
to 1 mile of visibility

289
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,660
okay
I get it

290
00:16:43,061 --> 00:16:45,101
if the visibility was down to zero

291
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:46,939
but this wasn't enough bad

292
00:16:47,342 --> 00:16:49,342
so what happened to this guy?

293
00:16:49,623 --> 00:16:52,123
why do we have a high time pilot

294
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,218
in a aircraft capable of flight

295
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:57,282
and visibility conditions he
should have been able to handle

296
00:16:57,382 --> 00:16:59,382
either lose control or somehow

297
00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:02,099
inadvertently flies
helicopter in the ground

298
00:17:02,181 --> 00:17:04,581
that becomes a key
piece of investigation

299
00:17:05,701 --> 00:17:07,994
we need to figured out
what he get actually see

300
00:17:13,823 --> 00:17:15,823
we have a request for the public

301
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:19,601
we're looking for photos

302
00:17:19,783 --> 00:17:21,983
of the weather in
the area of the crash

303
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,824
if you could send those photos

304
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:28,183
to witness@.gov

305
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:32,223
investigators make a plea
to the public for evidence

306
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,860
regarding the island
express helicopter crash

307
00:17:35,102 --> 00:17:38,302
that took the lives of
Kobe Bryant and 8 others

308
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:43,559
they're looking for clues to
explain how the pilot, Ara Zobayan

309
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:46,642
ended up hitting a hillside
on a route he knew well

310
00:17:48,542 --> 00:17:50,542
more than 8300 flying hours

311
00:17:51,065 --> 00:17:53,065
instructor on their 73

312
00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:55,499
chief pilot at island express

313
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:58,074
apparently Kobe's favorite pilot

314
00:17:58,423 --> 00:17:59,423
bit of a superstar

315
00:18:03,181 --> 00:18:06,043
this pilot was not a rookie
who just got his license

316
00:18:06,858 --> 00:18:09,458
he was one of LA's
top helicopter pilots

317
00:18:09,701 --> 00:18:12,201
working for one of
it's top companies

318
00:18:12,824 --> 00:18:15,724
with some of its most
high profile clients

319
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:19,002
record show that at 7:00 am
on the morning of the flight

320
00:18:19,262 --> 00:18:22,162
zobayan checked the weather
for his preflight risk assessment

321
00:18:22,898 --> 00:18:25,498
and determine that even
there were low hanging clouds

322
00:18:25,661 --> 00:18:26,661
blanketing the area

323
00:18:27,101 --> 00:18:28,601
the flight was low risk

324
00:18:30,499 --> 00:18:32,299
a risk assessment is

325
00:18:32,461 --> 00:18:34,461
weather, anxiety, sleep

326
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:38,283
all these factors
are going to a flight

327
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,580
but a low lying cloud layer
surrounding Lose Angeles

328
00:18:41,983 --> 00:18:43,983
known as a marine layer

329
00:18:43,984 --> 00:18:47,384
forced zobayan to alter
his regular more direct route

330
00:18:49,021 --> 00:18:52,803
because of the weather he flew
more inland than he normally does

331
00:18:52,984 --> 00:18:56,065
sort of a back door way
in to where they're going

332
00:18:56,387 --> 00:18:58,458
based on the forecast
this plan was okay

333
00:18:59,499 --> 00:19:01,160
pretty good visibility
all along the way

334
00:19:02,262 --> 00:19:03,262
so what went wrong?

335
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:09,541
investigators need to understand
the exact conditions zobayan flew into

336
00:19:09,622 --> 00:19:11,622
in the final
moments of the flight

337
00:19:14,139 --> 00:19:17,962
these are three separate cameras
all facing cells towards the 101

338
00:19:18,003 --> 00:19:19,803
couldn't ask for a better view

339
00:19:19,823 --> 00:19:22,680
the NTSB's plea for pictures
of the weather pays off

340
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,020
a nearby baseball facility
had surveillance cameras

341
00:19:26,062 --> 00:19:29,741
pointed a key sections of the
flight path as the helicopter flew past

342
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,681
let's see what this one
shows on a clear day

343
00:19:34,623 --> 00:19:38,323
investigators compare images from
the same camera taking on a clear day

344
00:19:38,741 --> 00:19:41,322
to images recorded at
the time of the accident

345
00:19:42,103 --> 00:19:43,403
yeah, perfect
okay, so

346
00:19:44,659 --> 00:19:47,859
one minute before the accident, the
helicopter would be bombing along here

347
00:19:48,861 --> 00:19:49,861
I can't see it

348
00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:52,299
how close did it
get to the camera?

349
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,582
best view of it would be here

350
00:19:56,263 --> 00:19:57,263
that's 4400 feet

351
00:19:58,419 --> 00:20:01,219
the helicopter is less than
a mile from the camera

352
00:20:01,282 --> 00:20:02,282
but isn't visible

353
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,222
okay so what
about larger objects?

354
00:20:04,624 --> 00:20:06,324
this hills for instance

355
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,160
visible on the clear day

356
00:20:09,941 --> 00:20:11,582
but not at the time of the crash

357
00:20:12,224 --> 00:20:14,224
that hill top is 8000 feet away

358
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:18,721
so visibility beneath the
clouds was less that 8000 feet

359
00:20:19,223 --> 00:20:20,723
it's mile and half

360
00:20:20,899 --> 00:20:24,599
the video study tells investigators
that around the time of the accident

361
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:29,318
zobayan would not have been
able to see any further than 1.5 miles

362
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:35,218
you only allow to fly in
visibilities one mile and greater

363
00:20:37,141 --> 00:20:38,341
mile and a half

364
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:39,862
pretty low

365
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:43,179
pretty minimum

366
00:20:43,781 --> 00:20:47,581
investigators know zobayan
would have been able to fly safely

367
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,560
bellow the clouds
with 1.5 mile visibility

368
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,561
so what if he was actually
above the cloud base?

369
00:20:54,221 --> 00:20:55,221
so he was only

370
00:20:56,418 --> 00:20:58,218
415 feet above the ground

371
00:20:59,461 --> 00:21:00,461
the cloud ceiling

372
00:21:00,902 --> 00:21:05,740
the base of the cloud layer was
reported to be 1100 feet near Van Nuys

373
00:21:07,101 --> 00:21:10,300
but zobayan was flying about
450 feet above the ground

374
00:21:10,641 --> 00:21:13,541
which would put him
well bellow the clouds

375
00:21:14,062 --> 00:21:17,079
there are images from the
camera on the 101 facing west

376
00:21:19,081 --> 00:21:20,081
okay

377
00:21:20,082 --> 00:21:23,819
you can just make him out here
actually heading into fairly heavy cloud

378
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,820
same camera
3 seconds later

379
00:21:27,098 --> 00:21:28,098
it's disappeared

380
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,540
we have a witness

381
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,740
who said that she saw the helicopter
disappeared into what she described as

382
00:21:33,899 --> 00:21:35,899
a thick wall of heavy clouds

383
00:21:36,981 --> 00:21:40,198
the NTSB had quite a few very
good witnesses in my opinion

384
00:21:40,379 --> 00:21:42,479
and they also had
cameras in the area

385
00:21:42,941 --> 00:21:47,981
so they can collect data in real time of
what this pilot would have been encountering

386
00:21:49,061 --> 00:21:51,761
the surveillance data shows them
only 450 feet above the ground

387
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:57,881
so the cloud base was no more
than 450 feet above the ground

388
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:01,360
not the 1100 feet which was
being reported along its root

389
00:22:04,422 --> 00:22:09,722
the reported an airport five
miles away can be greatly different

390
00:22:09,781 --> 00:22:12,781
than what you're encountering
because of uplifting winds

391
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:15,460
and that type of
thing around the hills

392
00:22:15,982 --> 00:22:19,659
the area near Calabasas
has its own unique climate

393
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:23,762
the Malibu Canyon can
channel fog up from pacific ocean

394
00:22:24,178 --> 00:22:29,220
that fog is known to pull precisely where
zobayan was seeing flying into clouds

395
00:22:29,821 --> 00:22:32,721
the fog gathers
here at murrell road

396
00:22:33,182 --> 00:22:35,839
and this is where our witnesses
saw him enter the clouds

397
00:22:36,821 --> 00:22:40,743
investigators have determined that
just over a minute before the accident

398
00:22:41,064 --> 00:22:46,339
zobayan flew into dense cloud that would
have reduce his visibility to near zero

399
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,100
that clinches it
he flew into IMC

400
00:22:52,864 --> 00:22:55,764
IMC
Instrument meteorological conditions

401
00:22:56,259 --> 00:23:00,159
is when visibility is so poor that
pilots need to fly only on instruments

402
00:23:02,659 --> 00:23:05,659
they were only authorized
to fly into visual flight rules

403
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,160
legally he's not allow to enter

404
00:23:07,662 --> 00:23:10,762
he's only allowed to go
in visual conditions only

405
00:23:10,779 --> 00:23:11,779
and yet he did

406
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:17,024
in aviation there is a term for VFR pilots
who fly into low visibility conditions

407
00:23:17,865 --> 00:23:20,865
it's called an inadvertent
encounter with IMC

408
00:23:21,828 --> 00:23:24,919
it can happen at night
flying into clouds that you didn't see

409
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,820
it can happen that you're
choosing to avoid something

410
00:23:28,923 --> 00:23:31,323
and you inadvertently
go into clouds

411
00:23:31,421 --> 00:23:34,461
unfortunately to accident
happens way too often

412
00:23:34,779 --> 00:23:39,320
inadvertent IMC is a leading cause of
aviation accident over the past ten years

413
00:23:40,422 --> 00:23:42,422
more than 80 percent
of them are fatal

414
00:23:42,705 --> 00:23:44,905
you can't see
where the horizon is

415
00:23:44,986 --> 00:23:47,586
and you can't see the
sky from the ground

416
00:23:47,819 --> 00:23:50,302
you don't know visually
which is our main sense

417
00:23:50,341 --> 00:23:54,099
you have to rely on secondary
senses such as sense of balance

418
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,940
and they are
illusions that come up

419
00:23:57,662 --> 00:24:02,080
an inadvertent encounter with instruments
conditions is so potentially dangerous

420
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:05,698
that pilots train to do
whatever they can to avoid it

421
00:24:08,701 --> 00:24:11,301
how did he get himself
into the situation?

422
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,993
let's see his speed and altitude

423
00:24:17,663 --> 00:24:22,163
the data from the ADS B gives
investigators a detailed picture

424
00:24:22,181 --> 00:24:24,381
of the helicopter
altitude and speed

425
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:25,463
as it approach Calabasas

426
00:24:26,186 --> 00:24:29,086
if zobayan try to avoid
the worsening conditions

427
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,760
the data would show it

428
00:24:31,542 --> 00:24:34,342
he's bombing along
here about 140 knots

429
00:24:34,939 --> 00:24:37,039
visibility is getting
worse and worse

430
00:24:37,182 --> 00:24:38,782
but he's not slowing down

431
00:24:38,902 --> 00:24:39,902
he's not turning around

432
00:24:40,338 --> 00:24:41,338
he just keeps going

433
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,900
why?

434
00:24:48,499 --> 00:24:51,299
he could have turn around
landed at Van Nuys

435
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:54,123
he could have circle for a while
near the airport

436
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,459
wait for the
conditions to improved

437
00:24:57,501 --> 00:24:59,001
for whatever reason
we don't know

438
00:24:59,063 --> 00:25:01,163
he chose none of those options

439
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,980
the team now considers
the widely held belief

440
00:25:04,984 --> 00:25:09,727
that zobayan was pressured to continue
the flight by his high profile passenger

441
00:25:11,466 --> 00:25:13,666
a lot of people wonder
after the crash happened

442
00:25:13,699 --> 00:25:16,540
if Kobe being Kobe might
have put pressure on this pilot

443
00:25:16,801 --> 00:25:18,101
to get to where he wanted to go

444
00:25:18,182 --> 00:25:21,582
because that's the whole reason that he was
taking the helicopter in the first place

445
00:25:21,624 --> 00:25:24,860
is to get from point A to point B
and do it without unnecessary delays

446
00:25:26,141 --> 00:25:29,141
the same passengers take the
same flight a day before the accident

447
00:25:31,186 --> 00:25:33,586
they scheduled
to take off at 9:45

448
00:25:33,646 --> 00:25:35,646
but Kobe changed that to 9:00

449
00:25:37,861 --> 00:25:42,904
they move it up by 45 minutes, so that Kobe
could watch another team or team's play

450
00:25:42,945 --> 00:25:45,967
in preparation for his daughter's
basketball tournament on Sunday

451
00:25:47,658 --> 00:25:50,358
so they get airborne
just after nine

452
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,500
and then this happens

453
00:25:53,342 --> 00:25:55,342
they're held up for 12 minutes

454
00:25:55,905 --> 00:25:59,005
November 2 echo x-ray
hold at site Burbank airspace

455
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:02,100
I have an aircraft going
around in an inbound citation

456
00:26:02,442 --> 00:26:06,742
investigators know that kobe's helicopter
was held up at Burbank for 12 minutes

457
00:26:06,921 --> 00:26:10,061
while zobayan waited for traffic
to clear the control airspace

458
00:26:10,622 --> 00:26:12,622
okay we'll hold at site Burbank
2 echo x-ray

459
00:26:16,802 --> 00:26:18,802
a little more than
10 minutes later

460
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:23,620
zobayan flew into thick cloud cover
that speed at speed of 160 miles an hour

461
00:26:23,905 --> 00:26:25,905
as he approach Camarillo

462
00:26:26,698 --> 00:26:28,898
in my opinion 140
knots is probably

463
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:32,520
twice speed he should have
operating in those visual condition

464
00:26:32,539 --> 00:26:34,039
he should have slow it down

465
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,861
was he trying to make
up for the last time?

466
00:26:37,343 --> 00:26:40,743
the team digs into Kobe Bryant
previous flights with island express

467
00:26:41,018 --> 00:26:44,601
to see if there is any history
of him putting pressure on pilots

468
00:26:44,662 --> 00:26:47,522
he took 26 flights with
island express last year

469
00:26:47,783 --> 00:26:50,260
and not once did he
pressure a pilot to keep going

470
00:26:54,262 --> 00:26:56,562
Kobe would never
put pressure a pilot

471
00:26:57,384 --> 00:26:58,384
I flew him for two years

472
00:26:59,059 --> 00:27:00,059
not once

473
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:04,422
was there ever any
amount of pressure from him

474
00:27:05,503 --> 00:27:10,503
investigators find no evidence that
Kobe Bryant or any member of his team

475
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:13,680
put pressure on zobayan
to continue the flight

476
00:27:13,702 --> 00:27:14,702
they had a history

477
00:27:15,422 --> 00:27:18,822
they scrutinize Kobe Bryant
relationship with Ara zobayan

478
00:27:19,107 --> 00:27:21,607
for anything that could have
effected the pilot's behaviour

479
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,040
on the day of the accident

480
00:27:24,223 --> 00:27:25,223
more than history

481
00:27:25,663 --> 00:27:30,296
the director of operation says that
Kobe's relationship with Ara was, quote:

482
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,380
warm and friendly

483
00:27:31,822 --> 00:27:35,022
he trusted Ara with
his girls and his family

484
00:27:35,064 --> 00:27:36,964
that they always wanted Ara

485
00:27:37,034 --> 00:27:40,434
the company's BP says
that their relationship was

486
00:27:40,621 --> 00:27:41,621
more like a friendship

487
00:27:42,623 --> 00:27:45,023
and that Kobe would
call him Mr pilot man

488
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:46,379
this guy sure were tight

489
00:27:47,942 --> 00:27:50,442
relationship may have
been pressure enough

490
00:27:53,581 --> 00:27:55,581
how's everyone doing today?

491
00:27:55,582 --> 00:27:59,746
investigators conclude that zobayan
close relationship with Kobe Bryant

492
00:27:59,846 --> 00:28:03,760
may have led to self induced
pressure to get him to his destination

493
00:28:04,822 --> 00:28:09,044
part of the concern here is that the
pilot was trying to complete the mission

494
00:28:09,304 --> 00:28:11,204
in part to satisfy the client

495
00:28:13,822 --> 00:28:16,922
investigators soon find
another important factor

496
00:28:16,943 --> 00:28:20,079
that may have influenced
zobyan's decision making

497
00:28:20,307 --> 00:28:24,061
six minutes before the crash he clears
Van Nuys airspace and head south

498
00:28:24,261 --> 00:28:27,461
tells controller that he planned
to stay low all the way to Camarillo

499
00:28:27,904 --> 00:28:28,904
stay bellow clouds

500
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,700
helicopter 72 echo x-ray

501
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,860
are you just going to stay down
that low all the way to Camarillo?

502
00:28:34,904 --> 00:28:37,204
yes sir, low altitude
2 echo x-ray

503
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:38,980
two minutes later

504
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,462
he starts following the 101 which
should lead them straight to Camarillo

505
00:28:43,582 --> 00:28:45,682
but as along the 101
for 2 more minutes

506
00:28:46,101 --> 00:28:48,201
until he hits this
wall of clouds

507
00:28:51,739 --> 00:28:52,739
24 miles to go

508
00:28:54,542 --> 00:28:55,902
he's almost there

509
00:28:56,062 --> 00:28:57,062
almost

510
00:28:57,103 --> 00:29:01,662
zobayan was less than 10 minutes away from
getting his passenger to their destination

511
00:29:02,181 --> 00:29:03,181
you're close to finishing

512
00:29:03,582 --> 00:29:05,782
you have a tendency to be
willing to tolerate conditions

513
00:29:06,424 --> 00:29:09,524
might have caused you
not to take the trip originally

514
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:13,440
the team believes Zobayan
was suffering from a conditions

515
00:29:13,462 --> 00:29:15,662
known as plan continuation bias

516
00:29:15,744 --> 00:29:19,920
when he decided to keep going
despite deteriorating weather conditions

517
00:29:21,662 --> 00:29:25,162
plan continuation bias
is an unconscious bias

518
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:29,360
to continue with the original plan
even when conditions changed

519
00:29:29,542 --> 00:29:31,783
in an aviation environment
it can be deadly

520
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,700
it doesn't take long for
things to start going wrong

521
00:29:35,742 --> 00:29:37,742
as soon as he enter that cloud

522
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:38,839
instead of turning around

523
00:29:39,259 --> 00:29:42,042
Zobayan decides to
climb above the clouds

524
00:29:42,382 --> 00:29:45,384
we're gonna go ahead and start
our climb to go above the layers

525
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,400
he start banking
further and further left

526
00:29:50,542 --> 00:29:51,542
descends rapidly

527
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:54,039
hits the hill here

528
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,021
the pilots unusual actions

529
00:29:56,061 --> 00:29:59,503
lead investigators to wonder
about the level of training he received

530
00:30:01,939 --> 00:30:05,422
he was trained to avoid IMC
and what to do if you got into it

531
00:30:06,379 --> 00:30:08,879
they discover that
zobayan was well trained

532
00:30:08,941 --> 00:30:11,841
to escape the precise
conditions he flew into

533
00:30:14,305 --> 00:30:17,919
this pilot trained routinely
for inadvertently IMC situation

534
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,260
more than that

535
00:30:19,261 --> 00:30:21,302
he was the chief
pilot of the company

536
00:30:21,542 --> 00:30:23,678
he set the safety
standards for all the pilots

537
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:28,179
and he trained them on how to
deal with instrument conditions

538
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,380
this is what he was thought

539
00:30:30,701 --> 00:30:32,401
a review of zobayan's training

540
00:30:32,422 --> 00:30:34,822
shows that he was
thought to reduce his speed

541
00:30:35,739 --> 00:30:38,400
use the auto pilot to
climb above the clouds

542
00:30:39,381 --> 00:30:41,181
and then declare an emergency

543
00:30:41,663 --> 00:30:42,663
his training was good

544
00:30:43,946 --> 00:30:46,026
but did zobayan
follow his training?

545
00:30:47,859 --> 00:30:49,940
here he is entering
an area of low visibility

546
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:52,381
still flying well
above 100 knots

547
00:30:53,143 --> 00:30:55,043
no evidence of slowing down

548
00:30:55,138 --> 00:30:57,260
investigators know
zobayan did not reduce speed

549
00:30:58,461 --> 00:31:01,042
they now wonder if he
engage the auto pilot

550
00:31:01,304 --> 00:31:02,304
play

551
00:31:02,739 --> 00:31:05,060
we're gonna go ahead start
our climb to go above the layers

552
00:31:05,581 --> 00:31:06,881
look at that rate of climb

553
00:31:06,942 --> 00:31:07,942
1500 feet a minute

554
00:31:08,943 --> 00:31:10,943
can be auto pilot doing that?

555
00:31:11,781 --> 00:31:13,781
that exceeds the authority
the auto pilot system

556
00:31:14,261 --> 00:31:16,843
therefore this climb was
being manually controlled

557
00:31:16,984 --> 00:31:17,984
all right

558
00:31:17,998 --> 00:31:21,500
but at this point he's just trying to
get above the clouds without auto pilot

559
00:31:23,063 --> 00:31:26,163
the higher zobayan
climbs into the dense cloud

560
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:28,184
the worse the visibility gets

561
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,640
but he never asks for help

562
00:31:30,702 --> 00:31:32,502
well he never
reports an emergency

563
00:31:32,943 --> 00:31:35,143
and never mentions being an IMC

564
00:31:36,259 --> 00:31:38,759
one thing he should
have been saying

565
00:31:38,781 --> 00:31:39,781
many many many

566
00:31:40,743 --> 00:31:42,423
tell you're in emergency

567
00:31:44,661 --> 00:31:45,661
he didn't slow down

568
00:31:46,342 --> 00:31:47,542
he didn't use auto pilot

569
00:31:48,024 --> 00:31:49,824
and never declare an emergency

570
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,260
he ignored all his training

571
00:31:53,621 --> 00:31:55,822
they are basic procedures
that should be followed

572
00:31:56,143 --> 00:31:58,043
and you have to
have the very cautious

573
00:31:58,104 --> 00:32:00,519
on approach to any sort
of instrument conditions

574
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:03,100
this was not evident in the
way the pilot flew that day

575
00:32:07,264 --> 00:32:08,264
by ignoring his training

576
00:32:08,667 --> 00:32:12,241
zobayan found himself in a
rapid climb with no visibility

577
00:32:12,541 --> 00:32:14,541
and without the
help of the auto pilot

578
00:32:15,063 --> 00:32:17,363
prime conditions for
becoming spatially disoriented

579
00:32:19,219 --> 00:32:23,682
Annmarie landman studies the
effect of spatial disorientation in pilots

580
00:32:24,503 --> 00:32:26,903
if you take away outside
visual reference from a pilots

581
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:30,041
then he or she will really
have to trust their instruments

582
00:32:30,702 --> 00:32:32,743
because if you don't have
outside visual reference

583
00:32:33,224 --> 00:32:36,019
then any sensation that you
feel can be very misleading

584
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:40,400
did Ara zobayan suffer
the effects of disorientation

585
00:32:40,463 --> 00:32:42,530
after flying into dense clouds?

586
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,220
2 echo x-ray
say intentions

587
00:32:45,741 --> 00:32:48,798
zobayan's last words show
that's precisely what happened

588
00:32:49,899 --> 00:32:51,899
we're climbing to 4000
2 echo x-ray

589
00:32:52,981 --> 00:32:54,421
did you hear that?

590
00:32:54,483 --> 00:32:56,579
it's like he completely
lost his bearings

591
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:02,100
the recording tells investigators
that zobayan believed he was climbing

592
00:33:02,263 --> 00:33:05,106
when he was actually descending
rapidly towards the ground

593
00:33:05,659 --> 00:33:06,659
in a steep left turn

594
00:33:08,501 --> 00:33:10,501
it's what aviators
called the graved spiral

595
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,120
so ride that aircraft

596
00:33:15,221 --> 00:33:17,421
no, in the mountains area

597
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,360
you're not
you're absolutely not

598
00:33:20,862 --> 00:33:23,462
the team has pieced
together a picture of a pilot

599
00:33:23,478 --> 00:33:26,479
who flew into prime conditions
for causing disorientation

600
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:30,422
zobayan's problem starts just
after he flies into the cloud

601
00:33:30,543 --> 00:33:33,044
he decides the best
thing to do is fly above it

602
00:33:33,666 --> 00:33:34,666
but as he climbs

603
00:33:35,114 --> 00:33:36,114
visibility worsens

604
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:39,662
and his reference to the highway
bellow and the horizon ahead

605
00:33:40,222 --> 00:33:41,222
quickly disappear

606
00:33:41,944 --> 00:33:46,347
it's all but impossible for pilots to
determine a plane's pitch and roll

607
00:33:46,459 --> 00:33:49,059
without a visual reference
to their surroundings

608
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,780
without visual cues

609
00:33:50,861 --> 00:33:54,402
the human body is unable to
maintain its special bearings

610
00:33:54,823 --> 00:33:56,823
the result is disorientation

611
00:33:58,499 --> 00:34:00,299
as the highway bellow veers left

612
00:34:00,781 --> 00:34:02,581
zobayan tries to stay with it

613
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:05,559
he puts the helicopter
into a gradual left turn

614
00:34:06,422 --> 00:34:08,922
he's not looking at the
instruments at this point

615
00:34:08,944 --> 00:34:10,344
he was perhaps looking down

616
00:34:10,385 --> 00:34:12,898
too search for the highway
that he was following before

617
00:34:14,299 --> 00:34:15,299
2 echo x-ray
ident

618
00:34:17,702 --> 00:34:21,901
zobayan now faces a distraction that
makes the situation significantly worse

619
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,460
ident

620
00:34:23,621 --> 00:34:25,902
he is forced to identify
himself to the controller

621
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:28,399
it's not only a distraction

622
00:34:28,421 --> 00:34:32,740
it forces him to move his head which
increases the risk of disorientation

623
00:34:35,462 --> 00:34:37,062
we advise pilots to

624
00:34:37,144 --> 00:34:40,640
not move their head around when they're
flying without outside visual reference

625
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,860
this is moving the
fluid in your inner ears

626
00:34:43,863 --> 00:34:47,422
and this actually makes you a
little more susceptible to illusions

627
00:34:47,782 --> 00:34:49,862
the highway now
veers off to the right

628
00:34:50,424 --> 00:34:51,424
but he's lost sight of it

629
00:34:52,104 --> 00:34:54,505
he's banking further
and further to the left

630
00:34:54,939 --> 00:34:55,939
without even realizing it

631
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,380
30 seconds from impact

632
00:34:58,661 --> 00:35:00,161
disorientation sets in

633
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,300
the turn is so gradual
and it is so slow

634
00:35:05,383 --> 00:35:06,383
that the onset

635
00:35:06,779 --> 00:35:08,679
it seems that he's
not feeling that

636
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,741
so for him stills feels
that he's flying left

637
00:35:12,064 --> 00:35:14,564
and he gets to 600
feet and start to descend

638
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:15,579
without even knowing it

639
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:19,480
it's clear that prior
to the accident

640
00:35:19,662 --> 00:35:23,385
the pilot really didn't know
what the helicopter was doing

641
00:35:23,625 --> 00:35:25,025
because he was
asked his intentions

642
00:35:25,059 --> 00:35:27,761
and he indicated that he
was climbing to 4000 feet

643
00:35:28,421 --> 00:35:30,921
we're climbing to 4000
2 echo x-ray

644
00:35:32,025 --> 00:35:34,419
at that point the
helicopter was not climbing

645
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,160
it was descending
towards a crash

646
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,220
and the pilot didn't realize it

647
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:43,980
he's now in a rapid descend and
likely looking for clear skies above

648
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:47,102
not noticing what his
instruments are showing

649
00:35:47,462 --> 00:35:49,062
without having
outside visual references

650
00:35:49,099 --> 00:35:51,240
and not being focused
on your instruments

651
00:35:51,623 --> 00:35:53,323
it's very easy that happen

652
00:35:53,342 --> 00:35:55,042
and it does happen far too often

653
00:35:55,865 --> 00:35:58,265
he's so far over
it's like he's lost his lift

654
00:35:58,899 --> 00:36:00,799
he's plummeting to the ground

655
00:36:00,861 --> 00:36:02,861
graveyard spiral
classic

656
00:36:03,422 --> 00:36:05,022
about a minute after
entering the cloud

657
00:36:05,022 --> 00:36:06,589
he hits the ground like this

658
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:07,664
almost on his side

659
00:36:08,059 --> 00:36:09,759
at more than 160 knots

660
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:13,282
there is no sign he ever figured
out what was really happening

661
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:21,502
Kobe Bryant and 8 others died as
a result of a all 2 common scenario

662
00:36:22,663 --> 00:36:25,063
a helicopter pilot flying IMC

663
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:27,105
and becoming disoriented

664
00:36:29,739 --> 00:36:32,339
we need something to
help pilots understand that

665
00:36:32,421 --> 00:36:35,503
just because you feel like your
body is being pushed down on the seat

666
00:36:35,539 --> 00:36:37,539
doesn't mean you're climbing

667
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:39,062
that device exists

668
00:36:40,063 --> 00:36:42,263
and it's helping train
pilots in the Netherlands

669
00:36:43,139 --> 00:36:45,439
the one of a kind
simulator let's researchers

670
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,692
reproduce the feelings
of spacial disorientation

671
00:36:48,741 --> 00:36:50,741
without pilots having
to leave the ground

672
00:36:52,622 --> 00:36:54,622
okay martin so how
are you feeling now?

673
00:36:55,104 --> 00:36:56,544
feeling pitched up

674
00:36:56,545 --> 00:36:57,545
you feel pitched up
yeah

675
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:02,720
investigators hoping to
prevent the kind of accident

676
00:37:02,743 --> 00:37:06,007
that caused Ara zobayan
to get so badly disoriented

677
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:11,441
are looking closely at the work
being done in labs like this one

678
00:37:11,502 --> 00:37:14,302
at the Netherlands organization
for applied scientific research

679
00:37:15,103 --> 00:37:16,103
or TNO

680
00:37:17,339 --> 00:37:21,462
we investigate the effects of spacial
disorientation on pilot performance

681
00:37:22,664 --> 00:37:24,664
zobayan believed he was climbing

682
00:37:25,225 --> 00:37:26,825
when he was actually descending

683
00:37:26,866 --> 00:37:29,366
and was unaware that
he was in a steep left turn

684
00:37:30,741 --> 00:37:34,062
he was suffering from two of the
most common illusions effecting pilots

685
00:37:35,498 --> 00:37:38,198
somatogravic involving
his sense of pitch

686
00:37:38,902 --> 00:37:41,402
and Somatogyral
involving his sense of role

687
00:37:43,059 --> 00:37:47,863
spacial disorientation is a factor in about
30 percent of fatal helicopter crashes

688
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:55,379
this rotating chair helps pilots
experience the effects of the leans

689
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:58,960
the inability to recognize
that you're in a steep turn

690
00:37:58,983 --> 00:38:01,483
when a pilot starts a turn
the fluid in the inner ear response

691
00:38:01,524 --> 00:38:03,665
and it's telling that
he or she is in a turn

692
00:38:04,298 --> 00:38:06,998
but after a while
the fluid sort of settles

693
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:10,196
so it's actually feels as if
they're flying level again

694
00:38:10,384 --> 00:38:14,285
this pilot is using his thumbs to show
the direction he believes he's turning

695
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:17,026
for the first few
seconds he's right

696
00:38:17,027 --> 00:38:19,027
but as the fluid
in his ear settles

697
00:38:19,379 --> 00:38:21,379
he no longer senses the turn

698
00:38:23,303 --> 00:38:26,924
this is the identical illusion
that Ara zobayan experienced

699
00:38:27,258 --> 00:38:31,058
it's why he never realized that
he had entered the gradual left turn

700
00:38:31,181 --> 00:38:33,381
once he lost sight
of the highway bellow

701
00:38:33,723 --> 00:38:37,341
even though his instruments would
have been telling him precisely that

702
00:38:37,621 --> 00:38:40,303
we trained them here to
really trust their instruments

703
00:38:40,423 --> 00:38:42,503
and to really be focused
on their instruments

704
00:38:42,906 --> 00:38:45,206
specially in situations
of low visibility

705
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:49,918
but the heart of TNO's
facility is this simulator

706
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,540
called Desdemona

707
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,260
so here is just what's
going to happen

708
00:38:54,383 --> 00:38:56,183
just have to wait for our mark

709
00:38:56,424 --> 00:38:58,264
and then you have
to just level the aircraft

710
00:38:58,459 --> 00:39:00,480
but you have to do it
without the instruments

711
00:39:00,742 --> 00:39:02,422
so only based on
your god feelings

712
00:39:02,942 --> 00:39:05,122
it's a disorientation demonstrator

713
00:39:05,705 --> 00:39:09,520
which safely simulates the effects
of pitch and roll illusions on pilots

714
00:39:11,021 --> 00:39:13,121
it's the only one in the world

715
00:39:17,501 --> 00:39:18,501
okay martin
you just first

716
00:39:18,621 --> 00:39:22,280
you just going to fly a little bit to
get quite a bit on the controls, all right

717
00:39:22,822 --> 00:39:23,859
roger

718
00:39:23,901 --> 00:39:25,368
so you have the
instruments available

719
00:39:25,399 --> 00:39:27,099
okay, let's start simulation

720
00:39:28,743 --> 00:39:30,983
unlike simulators that
are attached to the ground

721
00:39:31,504 --> 00:39:35,421
Desdemona can simulate unlimited
degrees of pitch, yaw and roll

722
00:39:36,021 --> 00:39:38,021
as well as the
forces of acceleration

723
00:39:38,864 --> 00:39:41,421
it's really important to have
simulator that can really create a

724
00:39:42,221 --> 00:39:45,382
constant force or constant
force of feels like acceleration

725
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,220
pilot Martin Kemner

726
00:39:50,341 --> 00:39:54,021
is about to experience the
same sensation that zobayan felt

727
00:39:54,023 --> 00:39:55,023
moments before the crash

728
00:39:56,859 --> 00:39:59,421
the instruments in the
simulator are turned off

729
00:39:59,983 --> 00:40:01,983
so he must rely
only on feel

730
00:40:03,059 --> 00:40:05,059
Martin, how are you feeling now?

731
00:40:05,061 --> 00:40:06,461
feeling straight and level

732
00:40:06,461 --> 00:40:08,979
let's ramp up the acceleration
and see how that feels

733
00:40:11,782 --> 00:40:13,782
now we're starting
the centrifuge

734
00:40:13,903 --> 00:40:16,583
and the cabin of the simulator
is pointing towards the center

735
00:40:16,979 --> 00:40:20,219
so for martin is actually just
feels like he's accelerating forwards

736
00:40:22,064 --> 00:40:25,306
the acceleration causes him to
mistake what's actually happening

737
00:40:27,801 --> 00:40:29,801
okay martin
what are you feeling now?

738
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:30,861
a bit pitched up

739
00:40:31,542 --> 00:40:34,083
and what do you think that
the aircraft is doing now?

740
00:40:34,424 --> 00:40:35,924
we're climbing now

741
00:40:36,042 --> 00:40:37,342
if you're accelerating forwards

742
00:40:37,419 --> 00:40:39,219
the little hairs
in your inner ear

743
00:40:39,661 --> 00:40:41,561
will actually give
a constant signal

744
00:40:41,583 --> 00:40:44,426
that it's the same as if
you're being pitched up

745
00:40:46,659 --> 00:40:48,559
we're climbing to 4000
2 echo x-ray

746
00:40:49,742 --> 00:40:53,742
it's the exact illusion that caused Ara
Zobayan to believe he was still climbing

747
00:40:54,475 --> 00:40:56,475
when his helicopter
was in a steep descent

748
00:40:59,823 --> 00:41:01,723
okay now
bring the nose back to level

749
00:41:01,783 --> 00:41:02,783
yep
sure

750
00:41:02,945 --> 00:41:05,466
so you can see that he's bring
the nose bellow the horizon

751
00:41:05,827 --> 00:41:07,927
for him this
actually feels level

752
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,940
so can we show
him the instrument?

753
00:41:11,462 --> 00:41:12,462
oh my god

754
00:41:12,822 --> 00:41:14,322
more than 10 degrees down

755
00:41:14,783 --> 00:41:15,783
okay 
here we cover

756
00:41:17,585 --> 00:41:20,799
we hope that this helps them to
recognize spacial disorientation

757
00:41:20,939 --> 00:41:21,939
when it occurs

758
00:41:22,101 --> 00:41:24,101
definitely we also hope
to teach them some skills

759
00:41:24,121 --> 00:41:27,029
that help them to manage
spacial disorientation if it occurs

760
00:41:27,144 --> 00:41:28,144
hello
that was it

761
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:29,859
that was crazy

762
00:41:33,942 --> 00:41:37,024
I believed that as a tribute
to the victims of this accident

763
00:41:37,065 --> 00:41:41,222
the industry needs to realize how
common and sinister these effects can be

764
00:41:41,301 --> 00:41:43,301
and develop better
safety standards

765
00:41:44,941 --> 00:41:47,241
as result of NTSB recommendations

766
00:41:47,502 --> 00:41:51,602
the federal aviation administration
is evaluating tools like Desdemona

767
00:41:51,746 --> 00:41:54,846
that can be used to train
more pilots how to recognize

768
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,703
and cope with the
effects of disorientation

769
00:41:58,544 --> 00:42:01,044
the last thing NTSB
was to do is to back

770
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:03,861
and investigate this kind
of accident all over again

771
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:06,580
and through the
death of this person

772
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:07,860
and people on board

773
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:11,080
hopefully this would be the
one to help improve safety

774
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:13,296
time will tell
