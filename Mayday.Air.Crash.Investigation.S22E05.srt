1
00:00:01,943 --> 00:00:02,943
stabilizer motion

2
00:00:05,019 --> 00:00:06,019
help me back

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:07,460
okay

4
00:00:07,742 --> 00:00:10,023
the pilots of Alaska
airlines flight 261

5
00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:13,980
wrestle with an MD-83 nose
diving towards the Pacific ocean

6
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,780
we've got it under control here

7
00:00:18,743 --> 00:00:19,743
no we don't

8
00:00:20,744 --> 00:00:22,744
the airplane
pitched down and rolled

9
00:00:26,301 --> 00:00:27,301
mayday

10
00:00:27,303 --> 00:00:29,898
it actually gets
inverted upside down

11
00:00:30,379 --> 00:00:32,901
amazingly the pilots managed
to keep the aircraft flying

12
00:00:34,042 --> 00:00:36,542
this is like an airshow maneuver

13
00:00:37,706 --> 00:00:38,706
speed brakes

14
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:42,748
just seconds from impact
the pilots right the aircraft

15
00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:46,201
they had one shot
to save the plane

16
00:00:46,502 --> 00:00:47,502
or all would be lost

17
00:00:47,943 --> 00:00:48,943
here we go

18
00:01:13,825 --> 00:01:17,025
Alaska airlines
flight 261 takes flight

19
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,302
climbing into sunny skies
over Puerto Vallarta Mexico

20
00:01:20,903 --> 00:01:21,903
gear up

21
00:01:25,826 --> 00:01:26,826
gears up

22
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,560
captain Ted Thompson
is an air force veteran

23
00:01:30,781 --> 00:01:33,062
he's flown with Alaska
airlines for 17 years

24
00:01:36,099 --> 00:01:37,099
thank you sir

25
00:01:38,382 --> 00:01:42,524
first officer Bill Tansky has
been flying for almost 4 decades

26
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:44,225
he's the one flying today

27
00:01:45,461 --> 00:01:51,384
the pilots on 261 were highly
regarded by their fellow pilots

28
00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:53,960
these were really
top-notch aviators

29
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,060
flaps up

30
00:01:59,024 --> 00:02:00,024
flaps

31
00:02:02,141 --> 00:02:06,105
the MD-83 is flying north to
San Francisco for a stopover

32
00:02:06,664 --> 00:02:10,862
from there it's short hop to its
final destination Seattle, Washington

33
00:02:13,703 --> 00:02:16,464
3 flight attendance tend to
the 83 passenger on-board

34
00:02:22,702 --> 00:02:24,202
50 minutes after take off

35
00:02:26,904 --> 00:02:27,904
strange

36
00:02:28,746 --> 00:02:30,746
the pilots become
aware of a problem

37
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,580
points AP TRIM

38
00:02:38,301 --> 00:02:41,922
trim refers to small adjustments
to the horizontal stabilizer

39
00:02:42,223 --> 00:02:44,223
that maintains the
pitch of the aircraft

40
00:02:46,701 --> 00:02:49,101
when that light
goes on tells the crew

41
00:02:49,101 --> 00:02:51,982
you're gonna have a problem
adjusting the nose up or down

42
00:02:52,501 --> 00:02:54,541
which is of course
crucial for flight

43
00:02:57,303 --> 00:03:00,901
the warning light indicates the
horizontal stabilizer is jammed

44
00:03:01,261 --> 00:03:03,261
pushing the nose down slightly

45
00:03:04,102 --> 00:03:05,102
let's check this out

46
00:03:06,063 --> 00:03:07,063
auto pilot off

47
00:03:08,064 --> 00:03:09,064
good idea

48
00:03:12,343 --> 00:03:13,343
wow

49
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:15,581
what's it doing

50
00:03:15,757 --> 00:03:17,117
it's pushing down

51
00:03:18,306 --> 00:03:22,382
first officer Tansky uses all his physical
strength to keep the plane's nose up

52
00:03:23,385 --> 00:03:25,662
the first officer is
hand-flying the airplane

53
00:03:26,179 --> 00:03:28,601
so he's manually got his
hands on the control yoke

54
00:03:29,581 --> 00:03:30,581
and

55
00:03:30,861 --> 00:03:33,983
increasing there is more and more
pressure that he's having to hold

56
00:03:35,104 --> 00:03:36,926
he's using a lot of arm muscle

57
00:03:37,627 --> 00:03:39,620
so this is something
that they wanna fix

58
00:03:42,983 --> 00:03:44,583
still climbing
that's good

59
00:03:45,463 --> 00:03:47,825
let's get to 310
figure this out

60
00:03:50,779 --> 00:03:52,879
by pulling back on
the control column

61
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,700
the pilots can deflect the
plane's elevator enough

62
00:03:56,022 --> 00:03:58,024
to enable the aircraft
to continue climbing

63
00:04:01,946 --> 00:04:02,946
21 minutes after take off

64
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:06,961
flight 261 levels
off at 31,000 feet

65
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,359
manual says try
the pickle switch

66
00:04:19,663 --> 00:04:25,326
pickle switches are literally just a little
toggles switch on the control column

67
00:04:25,506 --> 00:04:28,406
and it moves the
horizontal stabilizer

68
00:04:28,862 --> 00:04:31,159
such that it will push
the nose up or down

69
00:04:33,662 --> 00:04:36,782
controls in the cockpit activate
a two foot jack screw in the tail

70
00:04:38,181 --> 00:04:39,181
as the jack screw turns

71
00:04:39,906 --> 00:04:41,801
it moves the
stabilizer up or down

72
00:04:43,862 --> 00:04:46,144
they were having to
go through the manuals

73
00:04:46,395 --> 00:04:48,386
never asking each other
what do you know

74
00:04:48,464 --> 00:04:49,785
what we can do
what we can try

75
00:04:53,222 --> 00:04:54,222
nothing

76
00:04:54,343 --> 00:04:55,343
what about you try?

77
00:04:58,783 --> 00:05:01,783
captain Thompson tries to
activate the horizontal stabilizer

78
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,302
using what pilots
called a suitcase handles

79
00:05:07,222 --> 00:05:08,222
no dice

80
00:05:09,907 --> 00:05:11,619
it's like try to start your car

81
00:05:11,821 --> 00:05:13,740
they were trying
everything they could think of

82
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,643
to get their plane to respond

83
00:05:17,223 --> 00:05:18,723
let's try out auto pilot

84
00:05:20,305 --> 00:05:22,467
they hope the auto pilot
can keep the plane level

85
00:05:27,141 --> 00:05:28,141
plane is steady

86
00:05:29,683 --> 00:05:30,683
right

87
00:05:30,868 --> 00:05:33,879
I'm thinking we get this plane on
the ground sooner rather than later

88
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:34,940
yeah
maybe LAX

89
00:05:36,824 --> 00:05:37,824
call dispatcher

90
00:05:38,825 --> 00:05:41,425
if you have a control problem

91
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,706
you have to get that
plane on the ground

92
00:05:45,902 --> 00:05:46,902
dispatch
261

93
00:05:47,342 --> 00:05:49,142
requesting a diversion to LAX

94
00:05:49,621 --> 00:05:51,903
our longitudinal trim
system is inoperative

95
00:05:53,859 --> 00:05:58,543
captain Thompson contacts Alaska
airline flight dispatcher in Seattle

96
00:05:58,942 --> 00:05:59,942
dispatch
261

97
00:06:00,384 --> 00:06:01,384
copy that

98
00:06:01,665 --> 00:06:03,565
if you want to land in LA
for safety reasons

99
00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:07,060
we'll be looking at over an hour delay
because of the flow problem right now

100
00:06:10,065 --> 00:06:12,076
I didn't really wanna
hear about the flow

101
00:06:12,085 --> 00:06:13,726
I am concerned about
suitable airport

102
00:06:14,859 --> 00:06:16,839
do you have a wind at LAX?

103
00:06:17,141 --> 00:06:18,641
it's 260 at 9

104
00:06:21,944 --> 00:06:25,619
the pilots compare the wind conditions
at Los Angeles and San Francisco airports

105
00:06:28,381 --> 00:06:33,185
the pilots on this flight took such care
considering all their options on runways

106
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,440
there is headwind at LAX

107
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,982
but at San Francisco
there is a cross wind

108
00:06:40,462 --> 00:06:42,746
26 at 9 vs direct cross wind

109
00:06:44,707 --> 00:06:48,040
for safety reasons I think something
that lowers ground speed makes sense

110
00:06:50,822 --> 00:06:53,899
the headwind at LAX will
help make it a safer landing

111
00:06:55,022 --> 00:06:57,301
once your lined up
for the LAX runway

112
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:01,220
you've got perfect winds
coming right at your nose

113
00:07:01,779 --> 00:07:03,380
it blows off the pacific ocean

114
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,481
it's predictable
it's constant

115
00:07:06,182 --> 00:07:07,784
and it slows down your plane

116
00:07:12,942 --> 00:07:14,763
good to guys of the
horizontal situation

117
00:07:16,322 --> 00:07:17,700
ten minutes after rerouting

118
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:22,103
a mechanic at Alaska airlines
maintenance facility in Los Angeles

119
00:07:22,621 --> 00:07:23,621
contacts the crew

120
00:07:26,024 --> 00:07:27,024
affirmative

121
00:07:27,744 --> 00:07:32,263
the maintenance facility can talk directly
to the pilots to provide the MD expertise

122
00:07:32,823 --> 00:07:34,824
on the problem that
they're dealing with

123
00:07:35,943 --> 00:07:38,024
did you try the suite-case
and pickle-switches?

124
00:07:38,226 --> 00:07:41,826
yeah we try just about everything if
you've got any hidden circuit breakers

125
00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:43,899
we love to know about them

126
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,640
yeah I look into the circuit
breaker guide as a double check

127
00:07:47,542 --> 00:07:49,483
and the alternate
is inoperative too ha?

128
00:07:49,504 --> 00:07:52,840
yep, our horizontal stabilizer
appears to be jammed

129
00:07:53,183 --> 00:07:54,383
the whole thing

130
00:07:54,903 --> 00:07:55,903
okay
thank you sir

131
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:58,598
see you when you get to LAX

132
00:08:00,861 --> 00:08:04,104
the response from Alaska
airlines maintenance

133
00:08:04,223 --> 00:08:05,600
was basically no response at all

134
00:08:05,624 --> 00:08:07,624
they provided them no help

135
00:08:07,641 --> 00:08:10,341
the really the most they ever
said to them did you try the

136
00:08:10,503 --> 00:08:12,545
pickle switches and
suite-case handles

137
00:08:12,623 --> 00:08:15,567
which were one of the
first things that they did

138
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,021
let's try the pickle
switches again

139
00:08:21,943 --> 00:08:22,983
you've got it

140
00:08:26,181 --> 00:08:28,762
the captain is warning the
first officer as a reminder

141
00:08:29,404 --> 00:08:31,862
when we click the auto pilot off
be ready

142
00:08:31,986 --> 00:08:34,821
because it's gonna require
a lot of effort from you

143
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:36,381
right then

144
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:38,642
let's click the auto pilot off

145
00:08:49,142 --> 00:08:52,264
stabilizer motion
stabilizer motion

146
00:08:53,946 --> 00:08:55,846
the nose of the plane drops

147
00:08:56,509 --> 00:08:58,538
far more than the
pilots anticipate

148
00:09:00,381 --> 00:09:01,381
holy crap

149
00:09:04,424 --> 00:09:06,661
the airplane pitched
down significantly

150
00:09:07,261 --> 00:09:09,541
and the airframe
is shaking violently

151
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,226
they know something is very
desperately wrong with the airplane

152
00:09:14,283 --> 00:09:16,301
the problem is
suddenly much worse

153
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,441
flight 261 begins to nose dive

154
00:09:21,865 --> 00:09:22,865
what are you doing?

155
00:09:23,585 --> 00:09:24,585
it got worse

156
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:27,780
they have to get
the nose back up

157
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:29,943
or

158
00:09:30,302 --> 00:09:32,885
they'll have an unrestricted
descent all the way to the ocean

159
00:09:40,982 --> 00:09:41,982
help me back

160
00:09:42,423 --> 00:09:43,423
help me back

161
00:09:43,985 --> 00:09:44,985
okay

162
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:48,566
the crew of Alaska
airlines flight 261

163
00:09:48,698 --> 00:09:51,541
struggles to regain
control of the MD-83

164
00:09:52,903 --> 00:09:54,562
they pull back on
the control yoke

165
00:09:54,624 --> 00:09:55,624
holding a lot of force

166
00:09:58,307 --> 00:09:59,307
center
Alaska 261

167
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,830
we are in a dive here

168
00:10:02,939 --> 00:10:05,002
I've lost control
of vertical pitch

169
00:10:06,103 --> 00:10:08,103
Alaska 261
say again sir

170
00:10:08,344 --> 00:10:10,844
we are on a vertical
dive at 26,000

171
00:10:12,826 --> 00:10:14,944
they are now 3
minutes from impact

172
00:10:16,222 --> 00:10:17,222
speed brakes

173
00:10:18,783 --> 00:10:20,283
the pilots deploy
the speed brakes

174
00:10:20,748 --> 00:10:24,149
control surfaces on the wings
of their plane that increase drag

175
00:10:25,861 --> 00:10:27,361
any one to slow the plane down

176
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,745
it would also give them
more of a chance physically

177
00:10:30,942 --> 00:10:33,142
to pull the plane
out of the dive

178
00:10:40,219 --> 00:10:42,240
the speed breaks
are rest the dive

179
00:10:44,703 --> 00:10:45,903
using all their strength

180
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:50,140
the pilots bring the aircraft
back on the control at 24,000 feet

181
00:10:54,942 --> 00:10:57,524
once we get the speed slow
we will be okay

182
00:10:59,145 --> 00:11:02,259
in 80 seconds the plane
has dropped 8,000 feet

183
00:11:04,781 --> 00:11:08,739
the pilots pull out of the
dive with pure brute force

184
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:13,140
we've got it back
under control here

185
00:11:15,144 --> 00:11:16,144
no we don't

186
00:11:16,586 --> 00:11:19,161
even though they've
managed to pull out of the dive

187
00:11:19,201 --> 00:11:22,063
it requires extreme effort to
keep the nose of the plane level

188
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,363
okay
really wants to pitch down

189
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:30,623
they're really having to work physically
and holding the nose up on this jet

190
00:11:31,662 --> 00:11:33,862
they're in a fight for
control of the airplane

191
00:11:35,065 --> 00:11:36,465
it's a lot worse than it was

192
00:11:36,466 --> 00:11:37,466
yeah

193
00:11:37,498 --> 00:11:39,178
we're on much worse shape now

194
00:11:39,901 --> 00:11:41,681
this is a very experienced crew

195
00:11:41,721 --> 00:11:44,103
these aviators have had
problems in flights before

196
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,203
but nothing like this

197
00:11:50,099 --> 00:11:51,299
maintenance
261

198
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:52,299
are you on?

199
00:11:54,144 --> 00:11:55,744
22 miles from Los Angeles

200
00:11:56,384 --> 00:11:59,499
captain Thompson updates
Alaska airlines maintenance

201
00:11:59,939 --> 00:12:02,963
hoping for advice
on how to land safely

202
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,940
yeah 261
this is maintenance

203
00:12:05,022 --> 00:12:08,022
we've tried both the pickle
switch and suite-case handles

204
00:12:08,199 --> 00:12:10,899
and it ran away
full nose trim down

205
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,500
oh
it ran away full trim

206
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:14,884
yeah now we're
worse than we were

207
00:12:16,338 --> 00:12:19,601
this explaining that when
he commanded nose up trim

208
00:12:20,822 --> 00:12:22,843
the trim system moved nose down

209
00:12:23,344 --> 00:12:26,019
moved in opposite direction
of a way he commanded it

210
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,460
and it did so very quickly

211
00:12:28,701 --> 00:12:30,263
and it did so
with a lot of force

212
00:12:31,264 --> 00:12:33,964
you're getting full nose trim
down and no nose trim up

213
00:12:34,105 --> 00:12:35,605
correct?

214
00:12:35,758 --> 00:12:36,758
that's affirmative

215
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,600
we went full nose down and
now I'm afraid to tried it again

216
00:12:39,741 --> 00:12:42,241
to see if we can get to go
back in the other direction

217
00:12:43,147 --> 00:12:47,299
he is reluctant to try to
move it again for the concern

218
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,063
that if get worse yet
that they can lose control

219
00:12:50,742 --> 00:12:51,742
of the airplane entirely

220
00:12:53,304 --> 00:12:55,045
if you wanna try
that's okay with me

221
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:56,307
if not
that's fine

222
00:12:57,579 --> 00:12:59,099
see you at the gate

223
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:04,463
after the maintenance space at
LAX said I will see you at the gate

224
00:13:05,224 --> 00:13:07,362
the pilots knew
they're on their own

225
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:09,719
all they have left was

226
00:13:09,861 --> 00:13:11,904
they had themselves
their physical strength

227
00:13:12,102 --> 00:13:13,102
and their wits

228
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:15,503
to land the plane

229
00:13:15,665 --> 00:13:18,685
the pilots need to figure out
how to control their descend

230
00:13:18,786 --> 00:13:21,253
without using the
plane's trim system

231
00:13:21,298 --> 00:13:23,298
you wanna try trim
switch again or not

232
00:13:24,661 --> 00:13:27,124
no
I don't know

233
00:13:28,343 --> 00:13:29,343
it's up to you man

234
00:13:29,784 --> 00:13:33,684
they're literally test pilots
and they're having to utilize

235
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:38,263
decades of experience to try to
work their way through 2 solution

236
00:13:39,104 --> 00:13:40,824
we gotta touch with
people back there

237
00:13:41,665 --> 00:13:42,665
yeah
I know

238
00:13:45,579 --> 00:13:47,841
captain Thompson tries
to reassure the passengers

239
00:13:50,022 --> 00:13:52,264
folks, we've had a
flight control problem

240
00:13:53,424 --> 00:13:55,145
we're intending to
go to Los Angeles

241
00:13:56,827 --> 00:13:59,827
we're working on it and I
don't anticipate any problems

242
00:13:59,942 --> 00:14:02,504
once we've got a couple
of systems back on the line

243
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,160
with Los Angeles in sight

244
00:14:10,663 --> 00:14:12,743
the pilots prepare for
an emergency landing

245
00:14:14,344 --> 00:14:15,844
flaps 15
11

246
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:17,786
let's go to 11

247
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,740
the pilots test the plane
in a landing configuration

248
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,339
okay, we're pretty stable here

249
00:14:28,542 --> 00:14:30,242
but we gotta get
down to 180 knots

250
00:14:33,024 --> 00:14:37,381
the jet is very badly damaged
and they need to understand

251
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:40,723
and find a way to
control the pitch of the jet

252
00:14:40,945 --> 00:14:42,945
all the way through the landing

253
00:14:43,426 --> 00:14:45,347
if it's controllable we
ought to try to landed it

254
00:14:46,548 --> 00:14:51,001
first officers Tansky suggests
a risky high speed landing

255
00:14:51,021 --> 00:14:52,021
okay

256
00:14:53,022 --> 00:14:54,022
let's head for LA

257
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,820
their predicament was dire

258
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:03,223
they would not be
able to pull the plane up

259
00:15:03,824 --> 00:15:05,124
and do a go around

260
00:15:05,259 --> 00:15:08,661
the only chance they had was
one shot get it on the ground

261
00:15:09,502 --> 00:15:11,502
or all would be lost

262
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,566
but as soon as they
come up with the plan

263
00:15:17,223 --> 00:15:18,583
do you feel that?

264
00:15:18,944 --> 00:15:19,944
yeah

265
00:15:20,345 --> 00:15:22,363
the pilots hear thumps
of the back of the plane

266
00:15:23,707 --> 00:15:24,707
then

267
00:15:24,832 --> 00:15:26,112
disaster strikes

268
00:15:27,102 --> 00:15:29,002
the airplane
pitched down and roll

269
00:15:29,101 --> 00:15:32,126
they know that they are
in a life threatening situation

270
00:15:33,025 --> 00:15:34,025
this is pilot's nightmare

271
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,040
you're running out of time

272
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,080
if they do not control the jet

273
00:15:38,446 --> 00:15:40,446
very quickly
they'll lose the airplane

274
00:15:42,427 --> 00:15:43,427
mayday

275
00:15:47,902 --> 00:15:49,182
push and roll

276
00:15:49,626 --> 00:15:51,302
push and roll

277
00:15:51,345 --> 00:15:53,745
18,000 feet above pacific ocean

278
00:15:53,906 --> 00:15:57,021
flight 261 rolls left
and goes into a dive

279
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:01,443
this is like an airshow maneuver

280
00:16:01,823 --> 00:16:02,823
blue angels do this

281
00:16:03,266 --> 00:16:04,666
the thunderbirds do this

282
00:16:07,229 --> 00:16:09,229
dropping at 160 feet per second

283
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,344
time is running out

284
00:16:14,928 --> 00:16:16,528
okay
we are inverted

285
00:16:18,025 --> 00:16:19,025
now we gotta get it up

286
00:16:20,862 --> 00:16:24,163
when the airplane is inverted
this is a very difficult situation

287
00:16:24,265 --> 00:16:28,781
because they've got to try to determine
if they can maintain control of it

288
00:16:29,061 --> 00:16:32,144
and get the airplane
back right side up

289
00:16:34,662 --> 00:16:36,662
the plane starts responding

290
00:16:37,505 --> 00:16:39,505
they've pushed on
the control column

291
00:16:39,522 --> 00:16:41,122
to prevent the
possibility of stall

292
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:44,586
and then they rolled the
airplane toward wings level

293
00:16:44,944 --> 00:16:47,444
in an attempt to
maintain control of it

294
00:16:47,746 --> 00:16:49,446
push push push the blue side up

295
00:16:51,421 --> 00:16:54,121
the top side of the attitude
indicator is blue like the sky

296
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:59,000
and so they need to get the
blue side of the attitude indicator

297
00:16:59,024 --> 00:17:00,624
back on the top

298
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,860
on the ground

299
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:06,544
LAX controllers have
lost contact with flight 261

300
00:17:07,223 --> 00:17:08,223
Sky west 5154
traffic

301
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:11,659
at 1:00 o'clock is Alaska MD-80
do you see them up there?

302
00:17:12,466 --> 00:17:14,167
they look for help
from other pilots

303
00:17:15,027 --> 00:17:16,927
yes sir, definitely in
a nose down position

304
00:17:17,101 --> 00:17:19,101
descending quite rapidly

305
00:17:19,342 --> 00:17:20,382
he's inverted

306
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:22,570
okay, keep your eye on him

307
00:17:23,064 --> 00:17:25,564
Alaska 261
are you with us yet sir?

308
00:17:30,387 --> 00:17:32,387
30,000 feet over the ocean

309
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,202
the pilot's effort
seem to pay off

310
00:17:34,982 --> 00:17:36,982
the plane's nose starts to rise

311
00:17:37,545 --> 00:17:38,545
but it's still inverted

312
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:40,267
okay let's kick rudder

313
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,270
left rudder
left rudder

314
00:17:44,101 --> 00:17:46,601
the pilots are kind of
hanging upside down like bats

315
00:17:46,903 --> 00:17:49,146
and it was very difficult to
reach the rudder and pedal

316
00:17:50,866 --> 00:17:52,466
left rudder
I can't reach it

317
00:17:52,869 --> 00:17:53,869
okay
right rudder

318
00:17:54,309 --> 00:17:55,309
right rudder

319
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,000
their one hope was it
they could kick that rudder

320
00:17:59,062 --> 00:18:01,864
they could flip the
plane back over

321
00:18:02,745 --> 00:18:03,745
okay

322
00:18:04,147 --> 00:18:05,590
we gotta get it over again

323
00:18:06,148 --> 00:18:07,880
at least upside
down we're flying

324
00:18:16,222 --> 00:18:18,806
as the pilots fight to get
the plane the right way up

325
00:18:21,303 --> 00:18:23,303
the engines on flight 261 failed

326
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:27,947
there was a
disruption in the airflow

327
00:18:28,386 --> 00:18:30,383
into the engines and
it cause lost of thrust

328
00:18:33,183 --> 00:18:34,183
speed brakes

329
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:37,825
got it

330
00:18:38,107 --> 00:18:40,707
their demeanor was determine
collected

331
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,780
they were giving
everything they had

332
00:18:44,342 --> 00:18:45,842
the windscreen
is full of the ocean

333
00:18:46,342 --> 00:18:48,042
they're not gonna solve this

334
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,740
here we go

335
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:03,221
he's hit the water
he's down

336
00:19:18,145 --> 00:19:20,726
search and rescue helicopters
are immediately dispatched

337
00:19:21,267 --> 00:19:22,947
from coast guard stations

338
00:19:23,821 --> 00:19:25,521
search team find debris

339
00:19:25,782 --> 00:19:30,300
floating 2.7 miles north of Anacapa
Island of the coast of California

340
00:19:32,543 --> 00:19:35,743
in addition to pieces of the plane
searchers are finding personal effects

341
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,567
a shoe ,a password, a postcard

342
00:19:41,822 --> 00:19:44,899
aviation safety
advocate Mary Schiavo

343
00:19:44,899 --> 00:19:48,422
represents the families of
6 passengers from flight 261

344
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:54,323
I remember this
person's possession

345
00:19:54,739 --> 00:19:57,881
all the pictures were still in
the wallet in the pants pocket

346
00:20:03,698 --> 00:20:05,698
except for the
picture of his wife

347
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:09,583
and so we knew by that
and by how they found things

348
00:20:10,103 --> 00:20:11,703
that he had been clutching

349
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:14,945
that was really important to her

350
00:20:17,429 --> 00:20:19,699
rescuers search for
survives throughout the night

351
00:20:20,822 --> 00:20:21,822
none are found

352
00:20:27,503 --> 00:20:31,203
all 88 passengers and crew
on board flight 261 are dead

353
00:20:33,668 --> 00:20:35,668
it's terrible tragedy
thing, of course

354
00:20:36,219 --> 00:20:37,219
but

355
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,660
you know we have a real
well established procedure here

356
00:20:41,664 --> 00:20:43,664
for how these
tragedies are handled

357
00:20:45,581 --> 00:20:49,964
investigators from the NTSB
(the National Transportation Safety board)

358
00:20:50,019 --> 00:20:53,019
are assigned to find an
explanation for the crash

359
00:20:54,262 --> 00:20:57,805
LAX maintenance has said the
pilots reported the jammed stabilizer

360
00:20:58,227 --> 00:21:02,727
NTSB system's investigator
Jeff Guzzetti joins the investigation

361
00:21:03,219 --> 00:21:06,419
we knew quite a lot just from
the transmissions between the

362
00:21:06,823 --> 00:21:09,623
flight crew and Los Angeles

363
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:12,362
maybe they had a
mechanical problem

364
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,325
looks like they've tried
both switches, no luck

365
00:21:17,383 --> 00:21:19,383
plane pitched
full nose trim down

366
00:21:21,866 --> 00:21:23,566
we immediately began to research

367
00:21:23,859 --> 00:21:25,480
the horizontal
stabilizer trim system

368
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,040
to see how it was designed

369
00:21:28,102 --> 00:21:29,102
how it functioned

370
00:21:29,474 --> 00:21:31,360
and how the crew
operated it normally

371
00:21:33,101 --> 00:21:35,183
the leading edge of
the horizontal stabilizer

372
00:21:35,663 --> 00:21:37,563
is raised or lowered
by a jack-screw

373
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:42,741
when activated it moves up
or down through an acme nut

374
00:21:43,221 --> 00:21:45,782
changing the angle of
the horizontal stabilizer

375
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:51,541
we need to see the
jack-screw assembly

376
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:55,062
let's hope it's all one piece

377
00:21:55,905 --> 00:21:59,427
investigators wonder how the
horizontal trim system could have failed

378
00:22:00,939 --> 00:22:02,439
I'll get this to the navy

379
00:22:03,462 --> 00:22:07,980
recovering parts of the stabilizer system
could give investigators important clues

380
00:22:11,062 --> 00:22:13,301
but the wreckage field lies
on the bottom of the ocean

381
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,400
at the depth of 700 feet

382
00:22:15,862 --> 00:22:17,939
well beyond the
reach of scuba divers

383
00:22:18,381 --> 00:22:20,581
we were able to tell the navy

384
00:22:20,662 --> 00:22:23,162
what to look for
what the high priority targets were

385
00:22:24,298 --> 00:22:29,102
us navy crews use side scan sonar
to pinpoint the location of the wreckage

386
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:33,545
remotely operated vehicles
equipped with robotic arms

387
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:36,859
are used to recover
pieces of flight 261

388
00:22:40,262 --> 00:22:43,345
the black boxes are retrieved
two days after the crash

389
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,540
9 days into the investigation

390
00:22:49,663 --> 00:22:53,744
essential parts of the horizontal
stabilizer are also recovered

391
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,740
we've got the jack-screw

392
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:59,001
and with the brain power we had

393
00:22:59,018 --> 00:23:01,520
we had a fighting chance to
find out exactly what went wrong

394
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,100
during this flight

395
00:23:07,741 --> 00:23:08,741
what's this stuff?

396
00:23:10,302 --> 00:23:11,402
investigators wonder

397
00:23:11,463 --> 00:23:15,431
if recovered parts from the
horizontal stabilizer of flight 261

398
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,860
can provide clues
about why it failed

399
00:23:18,362 --> 00:23:20,162
it's some kind of metal

400
00:23:21,619 --> 00:23:23,219
what they see is puzzling

401
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:28,400
we saw this little
thin piece of metal

402
00:23:28,503 --> 00:23:30,584
that we thought
look like a slinky

403
00:23:31,064 --> 00:23:33,464
that really struck us
to something very odd

404
00:23:38,941 --> 00:23:41,135
why isn't the nut
attached to the jack-screw?

405
00:23:46,779 --> 00:23:50,480
normally the lower end of the
jack-screw is threaded through an acme nut

406
00:23:52,101 --> 00:23:55,823
when we looked at that and saw that
the jack-screw wasn't part of the acme nut

407
00:23:56,305 --> 00:23:58,078
we ask ourselves
how can that happen?

408
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,140
that really just blew our mind

409
00:24:01,382 --> 00:24:03,882
the jack-screw and
the acme nut fell apart

410
00:24:04,503 --> 00:24:06,503
then must have been
separated mid flight

411
00:24:09,306 --> 00:24:11,860
threads 1/8 inch
thick inside the nut

412
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,501
should hold it securely
to the jack-screw

413
00:24:24,739 --> 00:24:25,739
look at this

414
00:24:26,742 --> 00:24:28,780
there is something
unusual about the nut

415
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,540
incredible

416
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:32,862
it's completely stripped

417
00:24:34,383 --> 00:24:36,983
when we finally look
inside the acme nut

418
00:24:37,498 --> 00:24:39,561
it revealed that there
were no threads inside of it

419
00:24:41,181 --> 00:24:43,181
let's talk to metallurgy

420
00:24:45,665 --> 00:24:48,759
it was shocking and stunning
to us to see something like this

421
00:24:49,021 --> 00:24:53,780
no one thought that you could
get those thick threads to rip out

422
00:24:55,901 --> 00:24:56,901
interesting

423
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:01,301
metallurgist Joe Epperson examine
the stripped nut and the jack-screw

424
00:25:02,303 --> 00:25:06,703
it became immediately apparent
that what we were looking at

425
00:25:07,662 --> 00:25:13,298
was actually the remainder of
the threads that were inside the nut

426
00:25:15,261 --> 00:25:17,822
looks like the jack-screw
stripped the threads of the acme nut

427
00:25:18,902 --> 00:25:21,002
and the next step in the process

428
00:25:21,459 --> 00:25:28,019
was to figured out how the threads
were reduced to such an extreme degree

429
00:25:28,499 --> 00:25:30,299
and then stripped out of the nut

430
00:25:34,023 --> 00:25:36,084
there is some grease
here on the bottom

431
00:25:38,419 --> 00:25:42,041
the team studies residue
observable on the jack-screw

432
00:25:42,662 --> 00:25:45,715
the way to prevent
wear is by lubrication

433
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,060
with grease

434
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:50,780
and in the case of
extreme wear of event

435
00:25:52,019 --> 00:25:53,019
you want to look at

436
00:25:54,021 --> 00:25:56,562
is there grease where
it supposed to be?

437
00:25:58,264 --> 00:26:00,379
and there is some
here at the top

438
00:26:02,221 --> 00:26:05,286
in flight the jack-screw
rotates inside the nut

439
00:26:06,459 --> 00:26:09,459
to prevent wear, it needs
to be lubricated regularly

440
00:26:11,222 --> 00:26:13,603
there should be more
grease here in the middle

441
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:16,400
that's the working area
where it rotates the most

442
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,960
when we first looked
at the jack-screw

443
00:26:20,583 --> 00:26:26,180
there was very minimal size that
there was any grease on it at all

444
00:26:28,382 --> 00:26:29,582
it was in the ocean for a week

445
00:26:29,643 --> 00:26:31,663
did the water washed
the grease away?

446
00:26:32,184 --> 00:26:34,184
no, I don't think so

447
00:26:34,466 --> 00:26:36,087
grease doesn't
washed off that easily

448
00:26:38,619 --> 00:26:40,619
there is still some
remnants here

449
00:26:40,901 --> 00:26:41,901
but none in the middle

450
00:26:43,738 --> 00:26:48,780
we did find a little bit of remnant
of grease at the very upper end

451
00:26:49,339 --> 00:26:50,839
and at the very lower end

452
00:26:51,822 --> 00:26:54,822
there was very
easy to conclude that

453
00:26:54,938 --> 00:26:59,878
being in the ocean had not washed
away the grease from the working area

454
00:27:00,044 --> 00:27:01,984
of the jack-screw

455
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:06,841
how could it be that there so
little grease on this jack-screw

456
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:18,430
grease goes through here
during the lubrication process

457
00:27:20,782 --> 00:27:22,382
during maintenance

458
00:27:22,423 --> 00:27:24,323
grease is applied to
the interior of the nut

459
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:27,152
through small valve
called a zerg fitting

460
00:27:28,622 --> 00:27:32,227
so the zerg fitting is
this fitting right here

461
00:27:32,865 --> 00:27:36,458
and what mechanics have to do
is put a grease gun's hose in here

462
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,380
and then squirt grease
into this little grease fitting

463
00:27:39,461 --> 00:27:41,494
that goes inside this passage

464
00:27:41,943 --> 00:27:44,443
that zerk fitting should
have preserved and kept

465
00:27:44,506 --> 00:27:47,373
the remnants of
whatever grease it saw last

466
00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:51,102
what's that?

467
00:27:55,426 --> 00:27:57,426
it's packed with dried grease

468
00:27:58,548 --> 00:28:02,801
I've been around grease long enough
to know that if you don't replace it

469
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:07,218
and if you just leave it
eventually it dries up and gets hard

470
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:12,043
and it basically says that
it had not been replaced

471
00:28:15,064 --> 00:28:16,785
how long has it been
clogged like this?

472
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,000
at least a year
maybe more

473
00:28:22,705 --> 00:28:26,899
finding these blockage suggest
long term abuse to the grease

474
00:28:30,942 --> 00:28:33,138
I'd say we have a
maintenance issue here

475
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,040
time to talk to the airline

476
00:28:36,859 --> 00:28:38,559
we were very suspicious

477
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:43,165
about how well this
component was lubricated

478
00:28:43,344 --> 00:28:45,044
or whether was
lubricated at all

479
00:28:45,345 --> 00:28:47,345
and so we had our doubts as to

480
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:51,918
whether or not this component was
being properly maintained by the airline

481
00:28:54,621 --> 00:28:58,883
NTSB investigators travelled to
Alaska airline's operations facility

482
00:28:58,982 --> 00:29:00,262
in San Francisco

483
00:29:01,099 --> 00:29:03,980
you work on the plane in Sept 1999
is that true?

484
00:29:04,502 --> 00:29:05,502
yes I did

485
00:29:05,943 --> 00:29:07,943
they tracked down the
mechanic who was responsible

486
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:11,488
for the last lubrication of
the jack-screw assembly

487
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,940
4 month before the accident

488
00:29:14,942 --> 00:29:17,722
could you walk us through how you
lubricate the jack-screw assembly?

489
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:21,140
I'll tell you this
it's not my favorite job

490
00:29:24,743 --> 00:29:25,743
the team learns

491
00:29:25,745 --> 00:29:29,969
that jack-screw lubrication are
done most often on the night shift

492
00:29:30,021 --> 00:29:31,461
outside the hanger

493
00:29:31,502 --> 00:29:32,502
sometimes in the rain

494
00:29:34,901 --> 00:29:36,901
you're working
on high lift trucks

495
00:29:37,138 --> 00:29:38,138
which will sometimes move

496
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,860
with a gust of wind

497
00:29:40,882 --> 00:29:42,982
the airplane moves
with the gust of wind

498
00:29:43,343 --> 00:29:45,343
you're up at 13
feet off the ground

499
00:29:45,499 --> 00:29:47,499
some mechanics
don't like that job

500
00:29:47,782 --> 00:29:49,482
they're not stable up there

501
00:29:51,183 --> 00:29:53,605
to reach the jack-screw
assembly we remove a panel first

502
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,280
how do you apply the grease?

503
00:29:57,341 --> 00:29:58,341
I use a paintbrush

504
00:29:58,782 --> 00:30:01,204
sometimes put a big lob in my
hand to make sure it's on there

505
00:30:01,898 --> 00:30:05,601
aircraft specially large
aircraft need grease

506
00:30:05,861 --> 00:30:08,461
they need to have
lubricants and it's messy

507
00:30:11,187 --> 00:30:13,799
the most effective way is
to fill your hand with grease

508
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:17,103
and actually move it up
and down on the jack-screw

509
00:30:17,703 --> 00:30:21,341
filling all the screw grooves
filling them with grease

510
00:30:22,782 --> 00:30:24,864
what about greasing
the acme nut?

511
00:30:26,745 --> 00:30:31,280
investigators focus on how the mechanic
grease the acme nut on the jack-screw

512
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,702
we use a grease
gun to the zerk fit

513
00:30:35,663 --> 00:30:38,359
you pump grease unit you
see fresh grease coming out

514
00:30:39,341 --> 00:30:42,381
well how you know whether the
lubrication is being done properly?

515
00:30:42,463 --> 00:30:44,510
and when to stop
pumping the grease gun?

516
00:30:46,141 --> 00:30:47,141
I don't it

517
00:30:48,141 --> 00:30:49,541
would you be able
to see the grease

518
00:30:49,582 --> 00:30:52,494
coming out from the top of
the acme nut during lubrication?

519
00:30:53,781 --> 00:30:55,922
no I can't remember
looking to see if there was

520
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:00,504
one of the first
things that he tells me

521
00:31:00,546 --> 00:31:03,308
is he couldn't have known
that zerk fitting has taking grease

522
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:05,240
you have no idea
that it's worked

523
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:11,023
so we found a variety of ways in which
mechanics lubricated this component

524
00:31:11,584 --> 00:31:13,584
and that gave us some pause

525
00:31:13,825 --> 00:31:15,525
because it's a very
critical component

526
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:18,400
if you don't lubricated properly
you could end up with an accident

527
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,400
like the one that just happened

528
00:31:20,862 --> 00:31:24,462
the team discovers that the
methods air Alaska mechanics use

529
00:31:24,545 --> 00:31:27,012
to lubricate the
jack-screw assembly

530
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:29,019
don't follow
maintenance standards

531
00:31:29,581 --> 00:31:32,581
the last time that
jack-screw was lubricated

532
00:31:32,703 --> 00:31:35,170
was about 4 month
before the accident

533
00:31:37,468 --> 00:31:41,068
but it's not just the way the
jack-screw assembly is being lubricated

534
00:31:41,101 --> 00:31:43,101
that bothers the investigators

535
00:31:43,121 --> 00:31:44,697
it's also the frequency

536
00:31:44,742 --> 00:31:45,742
and before that?

537
00:31:46,183 --> 00:31:47,183
Jan 1999

538
00:31:48,986 --> 00:31:50,486
they're doing it every

539
00:31:53,462 --> 00:31:54,462
2500 hours

540
00:31:55,984 --> 00:31:59,202
they can see there is a long
period between lubrication

541
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,020
is that even within regulations?

542
00:32:04,142 --> 00:32:05,142
I'll find out

543
00:32:08,339 --> 00:32:10,722
we knew we had kind of a
research project on our hands

544
00:32:10,901 --> 00:32:14,101
some of the documents that we
requested from the manufacture

545
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,300
from the FAA
from the airline

546
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,300
came in the form of
internal memorandum

547
00:32:18,583 --> 00:32:20,583
from engineering departments

548
00:32:21,104 --> 00:32:24,227
or request from maintenance
to extend an interval

549
00:32:24,778 --> 00:32:30,943
it really began to paint a picture of how
the lubrication intervals were extended

550
00:32:38,822 --> 00:32:39,822
check it out

551
00:32:40,941 --> 00:32:44,661
the airline made multiple request
to extend the interval on lubrication

552
00:32:47,698 --> 00:32:48,698
1987

553
00:32:50,661 --> 00:32:52,761
the interval between lubrication

554
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,504
was 500 hours

555
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,820
the intervals between
lubrication are measures

556
00:32:58,901 --> 00:33:01,845
by the number of hours
the plane is in the air

557
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:03,547
1991

558
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,940
goes up

559
00:33:06,782 --> 00:33:07,782
to 1200 hours

560
00:33:09,064 --> 00:33:10,064
by 1996

561
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,020
increases all the up

562
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:15,980
to 2500 hours

563
00:33:20,905 --> 00:33:23,940
they just continue to
extend extend extend

564
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,100
approved by the FAA

565
00:33:26,542 --> 00:33:29,544
yeah, every one of
them was approved

566
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:35,780
investigators conclude that
the lubrication of jack-screws

567
00:33:35,863 --> 00:33:37,863
was not only conducted poorly

568
00:33:38,143 --> 00:33:40,686
it was also performed
less and less frequently

569
00:33:42,123 --> 00:33:44,559
if you're gonna extend
these lubrication functions

570
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:48,523
then you better be doing something to
make sure that what you're doing is correct

571
00:33:49,864 --> 00:33:51,869
but even if the lubrication
wasn't be done properly

572
00:33:52,619 --> 00:33:56,221
regular inspections should have
caught the wear on that acme nut

573
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:58,702
true

574
00:33:58,724 --> 00:34:00,459
they should have
inspected it regularly

575
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:04,820
was the jack-screw assembly
on flight 261 inspected

576
00:34:04,882 --> 00:34:06,882
when and how it
should have be?

577
00:34:06,924 --> 00:34:10,080
we looked at the maintenance records
for information about the last check

578
00:34:12,781 --> 00:34:13,781
I've got something

579
00:34:16,745 --> 00:34:20,560
investigators dig deeper
into the records of flight 261

580
00:34:20,982 --> 00:34:23,503
to find out how the jack-screw
assembly was inspected

581
00:34:24,299 --> 00:34:26,099
yeah, this doesn't
look right to me

582
00:34:28,022 --> 00:34:31,985
the team finds paper work which
reveals that during routine inspection

583
00:34:32,825 --> 00:34:35,025
a mechanic at the
airline's Oakland facility

584
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:38,241
observed that the
acme nut was badly worn

585
00:34:39,621 --> 00:34:41,621
do you sure the
rating was 0.040?

586
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:45,140
a mechanic who
did that wear check

587
00:34:45,221 --> 00:34:48,421
reported that he's
founded to be at the limit

588
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:56,201
this nut was wearing fast and
something needed to be done

589
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,980
lead mechanic order
the nut to be replaced

590
00:35:01,344 --> 00:35:05,620
this was evidence that someone had caught
the fact that this acme nut was worn out

591
00:35:06,742 --> 00:35:09,342
most the airlines
the decision would be

592
00:35:09,543 --> 00:35:12,659
we'll get the piece to the airplane
as soon as possible and replace it

593
00:35:14,061 --> 00:35:15,661
but the entries crossed out

594
00:35:17,744 --> 00:35:18,864
I don't get it

595
00:35:19,185 --> 00:35:21,940
but when we saw that they
had crossed out the first entry

596
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,020
that was very suspicious

597
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,460
something was up

598
00:35:24,901 --> 00:35:25,901
it was fishy to us

599
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,659
we have to find out
what went on here?

600
00:35:34,185 --> 00:35:37,506
do you remember inspecting
an MD-83 on Sept 27 1997?

601
00:35:38,698 --> 00:35:39,698
I remember it well

602
00:35:40,941 --> 00:35:43,441
investigators
contacted John Liotine

603
00:35:43,502 --> 00:35:47,664
the lead mechanic who reported
the worn acme nut on flight 261

604
00:35:49,979 --> 00:35:51,479
I wrote up the evaluation

605
00:35:52,821 --> 00:35:55,835
the nut is worn down
replace it

606
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,721
it was an alarming discovery

607
00:36:00,823 --> 00:36:03,382
in order for that
aircraft to be safe to fly

608
00:36:04,459 --> 00:36:06,981
that nut assembly
at the very least

609
00:36:07,581 --> 00:36:09,581
must be replaced

610
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,840
there's no doubt in my mind

611
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,520
it was the end of my shift

612
00:36:15,503 --> 00:36:17,505
when I came back
the next workday

613
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,260
the plane was closed up

614
00:36:21,021 --> 00:36:23,863
the plane returned to
service with the worn nut

615
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,220
if the nut had been replaced

616
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,622
the plane would still be flying

617
00:36:31,183 --> 00:36:32,830
and 88 people
would still be alive

618
00:36:36,502 --> 00:36:40,802
how can a maintenance
facility allow the airplane

619
00:36:40,821 --> 00:36:43,021
to be put back in
the revenue service

620
00:36:43,023 --> 00:36:46,164
with the wear that it
found on the acme nut

621
00:36:48,099 --> 00:36:50,399
when investigators
probed further

622
00:36:50,482 --> 00:36:55,220
they learned that the amount of wear on the
acme nut was rechecked by other mechanics

623
00:36:55,861 --> 00:36:58,482
they determined that it
was just within minimum limit

624
00:37:00,939 --> 00:37:03,521
Alaska airline's maintenance
misses a warning sign

625
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:07,323
the wear on the nut should
at least have been monitored

626
00:37:07,994 --> 00:37:08,994
but it wasn't

627
00:37:09,939 --> 00:37:12,041
the next time that
jack-screw was looked at

628
00:37:12,221 --> 00:37:13,921
was in the NTSB laboratory

629
00:37:15,623 --> 00:37:19,023
the plane flew with the
worn nut for two more years

630
00:37:19,221 --> 00:37:22,682
before it took off from Puerto
Vallarta on the day of the accident

631
00:37:23,423 --> 00:37:24,423
gear up

632
00:37:26,266 --> 00:37:30,580
first officer Tansky and
captain Thompson had no idea

633
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,736
that their stabilizer was
on the verge of failure

634
00:37:36,225 --> 00:37:37,225
strange

635
00:37:37,779 --> 00:37:38,779
points AP TRIM

636
00:37:40,622 --> 00:37:42,643
the team turns to
the voice recorder

637
00:37:43,143 --> 00:37:45,418
to find out how the
devastating chain of events

638
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,700
unfolded on board flight 261

639
00:37:54,891 --> 00:37:55,891
let's check this out

640
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,620
auto pilot off

641
00:37:58,903 --> 00:37:59,903
good idea

642
00:38:02,865 --> 00:38:03,865
wow

643
00:38:05,426 --> 00:38:08,226
30 minutes after take
off from Puerto Vallarta

644
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,702
the warn threads in the acme
nut cause the jack-screw to jam

645
00:38:12,143 --> 00:38:14,406
preventing movement
of the horizontal stabilizer

646
00:38:15,265 --> 00:38:16,265
try again

647
00:38:18,901 --> 00:38:21,443
the captain's trying to
rectify the jammed stabilizer

648
00:38:24,264 --> 00:38:26,826
while cruising at 31,000 feet

649
00:38:29,059 --> 00:38:32,021
the CVR picks up the sound
of a click followed by a thump

650
00:38:34,423 --> 00:38:37,826
we think that the pilot was
moving his thumb switch on his yoke

651
00:38:38,106 --> 00:38:40,960
in an attempt to move the
jack-screw through the nut

652
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:47,003
the threads finally give way

653
00:38:47,143 --> 00:38:49,155
and the jammed jack-screw
pulls up through the nut

654
00:38:49,979 --> 00:38:51,979
causing the stabilizer
to move upwards

655
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:55,584
a stopper is all the prevents
it from separating completely

656
00:39:01,179 --> 00:39:02,179
it's got worst

657
00:39:03,181 --> 00:39:06,323
with the horizontal stabilizer
pushing the nose further down

658
00:39:06,824 --> 00:39:08,824
the plane goes into a dive

659
00:39:09,945 --> 00:39:11,645
through sheer brute force

660
00:39:11,658 --> 00:39:13,680
the pilots hold the
jack-screw in place

661
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,720
and recover the plane

662
00:39:18,184 --> 00:39:20,264
okay, it really
wants to pitch down

663
00:39:26,622 --> 00:39:27,982
do you feel that?

664
00:39:28,345 --> 00:39:30,058
stop, let's hear that again

665
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:32,740
but 8 minutes later

666
00:39:33,182 --> 00:39:35,382
there is another
series of thumps

667
00:39:39,345 --> 00:39:40,705
do you feel that?

668
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:44,460
the stopper holding
the jack-screw in place

669
00:39:44,701 --> 00:39:45,701
finally gives out

670
00:39:52,027 --> 00:39:53,067
push and roll

671
00:39:53,699 --> 00:39:57,882
the damage to the stabilizer
makes flight 261 uncontrollable

672
00:39:58,223 --> 00:40:01,344
the plane rolls over and
dives towards the ocean

673
00:40:03,547 --> 00:40:05,047
push the blue side up

674
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,060
flying upside down

675
00:40:07,501 --> 00:40:11,023
the crew makes a last-ditch
attempt to right their plane

676
00:40:14,748 --> 00:40:15,748
speed brakes

677
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:18,579
got it

678
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:22,819
the pilots of flight 261 give
everything they have to save the plane

679
00:40:24,181 --> 00:40:29,278
it was just total professional
fighting for that plane till the very end

680
00:40:29,819 --> 00:40:32,019
and they express
the realization that

681
00:40:32,862 --> 00:40:34,362
the fight was over

682
00:40:38,461 --> 00:40:39,461
here we go

683
00:40:49,263 --> 00:40:52,124
I was seconded by what
I listened on the CVR

684
00:40:55,462 --> 00:40:57,462
this accident could
have been prevented

685
00:41:02,781 --> 00:41:04,322
they grease that jack-screw

686
00:41:05,058 --> 00:41:07,058
this doesn't happen

687
00:41:13,784 --> 00:41:17,860
the amount of money that
would have saved these lives

688
00:41:18,581 --> 00:41:20,581
it's a cup of coffee

689
00:41:20,862 --> 00:41:24,446
it's literally a few
dollars of grease

690
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,400
I still get angry
about it

691
00:41:31,503 --> 00:41:33,403
in the wake of the accident

692
00:41:33,504 --> 00:41:36,559
the intervals between jack-screw
lubrication at Alaska airlines

693
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:40,262
is reduced from 2500
hours to 650 hours

694
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,540
we lost 88 people

695
00:41:43,821 --> 00:41:45,821
because of lack of lubrication

696
00:41:46,664 --> 00:41:50,820
this is a maintenance accident 
pure in simple

697
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,520
it's truly a tragedy

698
00:41:56,824 --> 00:42:00,381
they just one of those cases that you
work on that's never gonna leave you

699
00:42:02,702 --> 00:42:03,702
not ever

700
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,060
it was tough
