1
00:00:01,659 --> 00:00:03,659
after losing their
electric generators

2
00:00:04,181 --> 00:00:05,181
okay
beacons off

3
00:00:06,183 --> 00:00:08,183
the pilots of Air
Illinois Flight 710

4
00:00:08,705 --> 00:00:13,401
shut down one system after another
to conserve their battery power

5
00:00:13,781 --> 00:00:18,722
it was probably the most
sickening feelings for both of them

6
00:00:19,945 --> 00:00:21,445
but efforts proved futile

7
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:26,980
all the passengers
and crew are killed

8
00:00:28,374 --> 00:00:32,566
NTSB investigators examine the
plane's electrical components for clues

9
00:00:33,186 --> 00:00:34,686
there's no short circuit

10
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,380
what about the batteries?

11
00:00:38,182 --> 00:00:39,182
no signs of arching

12
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:43,623
the cockpit voice recording
raises more questions

13
00:00:44,223 --> 00:00:46,223
are you using these lights here?

14
00:00:46,224 --> 00:00:47,224
I'll get that one down

15
00:00:47,661 --> 00:00:49,061
they're doing the right thing

16
00:00:49,102 --> 00:00:50,903
turning things
off to reduce load

17
00:00:51,103 --> 00:00:52,103
so what happened?

18
00:00:53,346 --> 00:00:54,546
have you got a flash light?

19
00:01:21,383 --> 00:01:26,504
Air Illinois Flight 710 departs from
capital airport in Springfield Illinois

20
00:01:31,502 --> 00:01:32,502
gear up

21
00:01:33,222 --> 00:01:38,029
32 year old captain Lester Smith
has been with air Illinois almost 5 years

22
00:01:39,981 --> 00:01:42,161
he's one of its most
experienced pilots

23
00:01:43,902 --> 00:01:44,902
gear is up

24
00:01:45,344 --> 00:01:48,962
first officer Frank Tudor has
been with the airline for 3 years

25
00:01:50,623 --> 00:01:52,905
he is considered one
of its top first officers

26
00:01:56,498 --> 00:01:57,498
1000 feet

27
00:01:58,901 --> 00:02:02,024
the pilots are flying a
Hawker Siddeley 748

28
00:02:03,141 --> 00:02:06,541
the rugged turboprop is design
to land on shorter runways

29
00:02:07,942 --> 00:02:09,642
these Hawker Siddeley 748

30
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:14,741
was one of the number of
aircraft built to replace the DC-3

31
00:02:14,742 --> 00:02:18,599
as a commuter / cargo
/ military type aircraft

32
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:21,780
but primarily used
as a commuter aircraft

33
00:02:23,183 --> 00:02:25,883
its the ideal plane
for a regional airline

34
00:02:25,943 --> 00:02:29,143
that connects big cities
to small towns in Illinois

35
00:02:30,982 --> 00:02:32,982
Illinois 710
radar identify

36
00:02:33,504 --> 00:02:35,527
continue to 3000 feet
clear to Carbondale

37
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,342
Illinois 710, 3000 feet
clear to Carbondale

38
00:02:39,421 --> 00:02:40,421
thank you
good night

39
00:02:42,263 --> 00:02:43,963
heading 175

40
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,880
less than two
minutes after take off

41
00:02:55,343 --> 00:02:56,843
it's the generator again

42
00:02:57,585 --> 00:02:59,585
a generators warning
light comes on

43
00:02:59,826 --> 00:03:04,821
the aircraft is equipped
with two 9 kw generators

44
00:03:05,182 --> 00:03:08,800
that supply power to the battery
banks and electrical systems

45
00:03:09,702 --> 00:03:11,702
one of the generators has failed

46
00:03:13,385 --> 00:03:14,885
isolating it now

47
00:03:16,186 --> 00:03:18,686
the first officer disconnects
the right generator

48
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:22,195
to protect the rest of the
aircraft's electrical system

49
00:03:24,064 --> 00:03:27,079
when something like this happens
and you have a generator failure

50
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:29,559
one of the most
importance steps is to

51
00:03:29,701 --> 00:03:33,944
disconnect that generator from
the system as quickly as possible

52
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:39,419
Jeanene Urban is a
former air Illinois pilot

53
00:03:39,783 --> 00:03:42,063
who landed the plane in
Springfield 3 hour earlier

54
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:46,979
the generators are each
rated to be able to carry

55
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:49,462
the entire load

56
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:52,739
so if one generator goes down

57
00:03:53,022 --> 00:03:56,022
you can continue
to your destination

58
00:03:56,423 --> 00:03:57,923
it's not an emergency

59
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,200
tonight 40 minute flight

60
00:04:01,221 --> 00:04:05,829
is taking 7 passengers 146 miles
from Springfield to Carbondale Illinois

61
00:04:09,621 --> 00:04:11,221
Springfield
Illinois 710

62
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:14,440
we've experienced a
slight electrical problem

63
00:04:14,701 --> 00:04:15,701
we'll keep you advised

64
00:04:16,822 --> 00:04:19,422
Illinois 710, do you intend
to return to Springfield?

65
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,500
negative, continuing
to Carbondale

66
00:04:22,142 --> 00:04:23,142
3000 feet

67
00:04:24,824 --> 00:04:27,968
the captain decides it's
safe to continue the flight

68
00:04:28,498 --> 00:04:30,680
I understand, you're
continuing to Carbondale

69
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:32,021
roger

70
00:04:35,104 --> 00:04:37,300
there's dense cloud
cover this evening

71
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,200
the conditions that
Carbondale were

72
00:04:41,307 --> 00:04:43,580
what is called IFR
Instrument flight rules

73
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,701
they would have been
operating in the clouds

74
00:04:46,702 --> 00:04:49,823
needed their instruments
to be able to fly the airplane

75
00:04:51,505 --> 00:04:53,780
they were flying in the
deteriorating weather conditions

76
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,204
it's something that every year
airline pilot is trained to handle

77
00:04:57,743 --> 00:04:59,764
but it doesn't give you
much room for error

78
00:05:03,381 --> 00:05:04,981
4 minutes after take off

79
00:05:05,342 --> 00:05:07,803
the first officer checks
the status of the generators

80
00:05:09,304 --> 00:05:11,305
zero voltage and
amps on the left side

81
00:05:12,147 --> 00:05:15,021
he discovers that the
left generator is dead

82
00:05:15,862 --> 00:05:18,542
the right generator is
putting out 27.5 volts

83
00:05:19,383 --> 00:05:21,886
the right generator now
appears to be working

84
00:05:22,498 --> 00:05:26,481
but the first officer is unable to
reconnect it to the electrical system

85
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,341
I can't get it to come online

86
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,820
the right generator
is as good as dead

87
00:05:32,702 --> 00:05:34,702
with both generators out

88
00:05:34,703 --> 00:05:36,768
all the systems are
feeding off the batteries

89
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:37,990
instead of the generators

90
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:40,199
it's not a good situation

91
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:45,785
the aircraft has
4 Ni-Ca batteries

92
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:47,625
with no generators

93
00:05:48,066 --> 00:05:50,566
the batteries are
now powering lights

94
00:05:51,141 --> 00:05:52,141
instruments

95
00:05:52,701 --> 00:05:54,201
navigational equipment

96
00:05:54,422 --> 00:05:56,422
and everything in
the passenger cabin

97
00:05:59,741 --> 00:06:00,741
how are the batteries?

98
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,963
we're down to 22.5 volts

99
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:08,262
so now they were operating
on only battery power

100
00:06:08,861 --> 00:06:13,361
the priority problem is that the
batteries are only designed to operate

101
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,001
for about 30 minutes
under the best case scenario

102
00:06:18,944 --> 00:06:22,361
Illinois 710 is now 32
minutes from its destination

103
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,843
if they don't reduce
the drain on the batteries

104
00:06:27,702 --> 00:06:30,502
it will be almost impossible
to land without lights

105
00:06:30,544 --> 00:06:32,044
instruments or a radio

106
00:06:34,501 --> 00:06:35,501
okay
beacons off

107
00:06:37,343 --> 00:06:38,343
okay

108
00:06:40,185 --> 00:06:41,185
nav lights are off

109
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:44,558
are you using these lights here?

110
00:06:44,981 --> 00:06:46,481
I'll get that one down

111
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,582
the pilots quickly shut
down non essentials systems

112
00:06:54,579 --> 00:06:57,079
the sooner they start
shutting things down

113
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,880
the longer the
battery is going to last

114
00:07:01,023 --> 00:07:02,523
how are the batteries?

115
00:07:03,306 --> 00:07:04,306
pretty good

116
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:06,019
21.5

117
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:11,343
the efforts to conserve battery
powers seemed to be paying off

118
00:07:12,984 --> 00:07:14,984
should it last to Carbondale?

119
00:07:15,498 --> 00:07:16,498
yeah

120
00:07:19,183 --> 00:07:21,183
mid way to their destination

121
00:07:21,739 --> 00:07:23,239
the weather deteriorate

122
00:07:25,702 --> 00:07:29,420
the weather that Frank and Lester
encounter trying to get down to Carbondale

123
00:07:30,181 --> 00:07:32,681
was much stormy than Springfield

124
00:07:33,023 --> 00:07:36,701
there were level 2
and 3 thunderstorms

125
00:07:45,801 --> 00:07:47,601
45 miles from Carbondale

126
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:49,581
the crew tunes into a signal

127
00:07:49,624 --> 00:07:52,179
that will provide a precise
bearing to the airport

128
00:07:54,701 --> 00:07:56,501
meanwhile air traffic control

129
00:07:56,983 --> 00:08:00,144
transfers the flight to the approach
frequency for southern Illinois

130
00:08:02,058 --> 00:08:03,558
air Illinois flight 710

131
00:08:03,741 --> 00:08:06,782
contact Kansas city
center on frequency 125.3

132
00:08:08,264 --> 00:08:09,264
25.3
roger

133
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:10,899
air Illinois 710

134
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,420
they were getting
close to the airport

135
00:08:17,061 --> 00:08:20,722
and that approach control
facility would have lined them up

136
00:08:20,743 --> 00:08:22,743
for an instrument approach

137
00:08:24,426 --> 00:08:26,426
after contacting
approach control

138
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,040
the situation worsens

139
00:08:30,663 --> 00:08:33,184
I don't know if we have
enough juice to get out of this

140
00:08:34,064 --> 00:08:38,582
the radios and transponder
on flight 710 have shut down

141
00:08:39,702 --> 00:08:41,802
the pilots are now on their own

142
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,300
Illinois 710
I've lost radar contact

143
00:08:48,703 --> 00:08:52,320
flight 710 has disappeared
from air traffic control's radar

144
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,120
Illinois 710
Kansas city

145
00:08:56,503 --> 00:09:00,019
they had no capability
at this point to get help

146
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:06,661
it was probably the most
sickening feeling for both of them

147
00:09:07,502 --> 00:09:09,502
that you or I could imagine

148
00:09:11,144 --> 00:09:12,504
watch my altitude

149
00:09:12,864 --> 00:09:14,564
I'm going down to 240 feet

150
00:09:16,421 --> 00:09:18,662
concerned their
instruments are about to fail

151
00:09:19,503 --> 00:09:22,624
the captain attempts
to get below the clouds

152
00:09:24,587 --> 00:09:27,147
he was desperately
hoping that he could see

153
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:29,703
the airport beacon
or some runway lights

154
00:09:30,182 --> 00:09:32,182
and land that airplane visually

155
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,260
just 8 minutes from landing

156
00:09:37,223 --> 00:09:38,623
have you got a flash light?

157
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:39,745
yeah

158
00:09:39,865 --> 00:09:41,865
the batteries are
almost depleted

159
00:09:41,865 --> 00:09:44,065
here we go
you wanna shine it up here

160
00:09:44,379 --> 00:09:47,200
trying to illuminate the
instruments with the flash light

161
00:09:47,224 --> 00:09:48,224
in a dark cockpit

162
00:09:48,945 --> 00:09:49,945
is very abnormal

163
00:09:50,942 --> 00:09:53,342
and as he pointed at
instrument that's dis-functioning

164
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,860
or one that's not

165
00:09:56,022 --> 00:09:58,023
we're losing everything
down to 30 volts

166
00:09:59,946 --> 00:10:00,946
watch my altitude frank

167
00:10:01,939 --> 00:10:05,421
it would have been
a total panic situation

168
00:10:05,979 --> 00:10:09,301
and realizing that
they were out of options

169
00:10:14,706 --> 00:10:16,406
okay
2400

170
00:10:17,547 --> 00:10:19,571
rapidly losing electrical power

171
00:10:20,109 --> 00:10:22,109
and operating in total darkness

172
00:10:22,662 --> 00:10:26,625
the pilots of Illinois flight 710
desperately try to land their plane

173
00:10:28,802 --> 00:10:30,702
the conditions at
Carbondale were

174
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:34,132
such that one mile of
visibility in light rain and fog

175
00:10:34,424 --> 00:10:36,024
his chance of seeing anything

176
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,625
were minimum a best

177
00:10:40,027 --> 00:10:42,027
do you have any instruments?

178
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,820
do you have a horizon?

179
00:10:47,345 --> 00:10:49,999
they're in a dark cockpit
instruments are failing

180
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,460
they can't see anything outside

181
00:10:52,743 --> 00:10:54,385
they were now into
a critical emergency

182
00:10:55,306 --> 00:10:56,306
okay

183
00:10:56,584 --> 00:10:57,784
you bank in left
6 degrees

184
00:10:59,067 --> 00:11:01,067
okay
correcting to the right

185
00:11:05,542 --> 00:11:06,582
a little more

186
00:11:25,183 --> 00:11:27,083
Illinois 710
Kansas city

187
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,103
do you read?

188
00:11:28,824 --> 00:11:31,899
I would be very surprise they
knew that they were going to hit

189
00:11:31,939 --> 00:11:34,040
I would be very surprised
they saw the ground at all

190
00:11:36,422 --> 00:11:38,659
air Illinois flight 710 crashes

191
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,542
25 miles north of
Carbondale airport

192
00:11:44,064 --> 00:11:46,144
the wreckage scattered
across farm land

193
00:11:46,612 --> 00:11:48,612
near the town of Pinckneyville

194
00:11:49,621 --> 00:11:52,742
all 7 passengers and 3
crew members are dead

195
00:11:58,341 --> 00:12:01,362
the national transportation
safety board (NTSB)

196
00:12:01,432 --> 00:12:05,385
begins an investigation to
determine what happened to flight 710

197
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,059
let's see what we've got here

198
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:13,285
they begin by reviewing
the debris pattern

199
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,120
it's half a mile long

200
00:12:21,101 --> 00:12:22,101
and

201
00:12:24,183 --> 00:12:25,683
roughly 200 feet wide

202
00:12:26,986 --> 00:12:30,022
investigators get a sense
of the vast impact area

203
00:12:31,222 --> 00:12:33,679
which extends across
two small wooded areas

204
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:35,519
a field and a pond

205
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,260
they came in at a shallow angle

206
00:12:38,262 --> 00:12:41,484
the wreckage pattern gave
us the idea that this was a

207
00:12:41,938 --> 00:12:43,438
a fairly high speed

208
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,160
low angle impact

209
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:47,759
to be able to spread
the wreckage like this

210
00:12:48,221 --> 00:12:49,221
over a half a mile

211
00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:53,379
first point of
impact is right here

212
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:55,841
there's ground scars and debris

213
00:12:56,978 --> 00:12:57,978
heading north

214
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,040
Carbondale airport is
25 miles to the south

215
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,500
investigators determine
that at the time of the crash

216
00:13:06,862 --> 00:13:10,644
flight 710 was flying in the
opposite direction to its destination

217
00:13:11,945 --> 00:13:14,479
with the aircraft
traveling the way it was

218
00:13:15,008 --> 00:13:17,681
at that speed and
in a wrong direction

219
00:13:18,142 --> 00:13:19,142
it made us wonder

220
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,540
was the aircraft
actually under control?

221
00:13:22,154 --> 00:13:23,954
so first ground scare here

222
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,980
followed by a few more

223
00:13:27,502 --> 00:13:29,702
and the 200 feet
in front of that

224
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,620
the right wing tip

225
00:13:33,864 --> 00:13:35,864
near the first impact marks

226
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:39,101
investigators discover fragments
of a green navigation light

227
00:13:39,462 --> 00:13:41,084
from their plane's
right wing tip

228
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,900
it was bank to the right
when it hit the ground

229
00:13:45,703 --> 00:13:47,403
we had the right wing tip

230
00:13:47,423 --> 00:13:49,880
we knew that was the
first thing that hit the ground

231
00:13:50,222 --> 00:13:53,220
and we could measure
approximately 30 degree right bang

232
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:58,384
did the crew report any
issues to air traffic controller?

233
00:13:58,859 --> 00:13:59,859
yeah
they did

234
00:14:03,123 --> 00:14:04,823
Springfield
Illinois 710

235
00:14:05,341 --> 00:14:07,881
we have experienced
the slight electrical problem

236
00:14:08,424 --> 00:14:10,024
we'll keep you advised

237
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:15,521
investigators learned that 90
seconds after taking off from Springfield

238
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,742
the crew reported
an electrical problem

239
00:14:19,667 --> 00:14:20,667
anything else

240
00:14:21,664 --> 00:14:24,464
that's it
just the electrical problem

241
00:14:26,701 --> 00:14:29,660
we'll need to take a good look
at all the electrical components

242
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,322
the pilot reported a
slight electrical problem

243
00:14:33,944 --> 00:14:36,759
and it was up to
us to figured it out

244
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:38,800
what his problem was
and why they crashed

245
00:14:45,186 --> 00:14:46,186
is these everything?

246
00:14:47,466 --> 00:14:49,866
investigators examine
electrical components

247
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,940
for evidence of malfunctions

248
00:14:54,263 --> 00:14:56,623
wires are clean
there is no short circuit

249
00:15:03,183 --> 00:15:04,983
this inverter is in bad shape

250
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:09,659
hard to tell they
were working or not

251
00:15:12,499 --> 00:15:14,099
what about the batteries?

252
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:20,305
4 Ni-Ca batteries are
powered by 2 generators

253
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:24,804
each battery contains
18 individual battery cells

254
00:15:26,306 --> 00:15:29,548
no signs of arching or short
circuit as a result of the impact

255
00:15:31,022 --> 00:15:34,702
we were able to recover total
of 10 cells from the batteries

256
00:15:35,223 --> 00:15:37,223
and they were all
in descent shape

257
00:15:37,465 --> 00:15:39,465
see if they can hold a charge

258
00:15:40,862 --> 00:15:44,122
under normal conditions the
batteries should be fully charged

259
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:49,481
they're dead

260
00:15:50,544 --> 00:15:52,686
the batteries are
able to hold its charge

261
00:15:52,783 --> 00:15:55,367
but for some reason
they were run down

262
00:15:57,864 --> 00:16:00,064
did the generators malfunction?

263
00:16:00,621 --> 00:16:02,721
and failed to
charge the batteries

264
00:16:03,706 --> 00:16:04,706
now the left generator

265
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:09,739
aircraft engines power
a generator's shaft

266
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:13,140
to rotate a metal core
wrapped in copper coil

267
00:16:14,061 --> 00:16:16,061
this is known as an armature

268
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:20,080
the armature spins rapidly
between the poles of a magnet

269
00:16:20,261 --> 00:16:21,261
to generate electricity

270
00:16:25,345 --> 00:16:26,845
banding wire is come off

271
00:16:28,179 --> 00:16:32,704
banding wire is used to hold the armature
together as it spins inside the assembly

272
00:16:34,065 --> 00:16:35,765
if the banding wire comes lose

273
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,600
the armature could jam

274
00:16:45,299 --> 00:16:46,299
soldering is melted

275
00:16:47,821 --> 00:16:49,821
the motor must have overheated

276
00:16:51,739 --> 00:16:55,821
investigators discover evidence
that the left generator failed

277
00:16:56,822 --> 00:16:58,822
this happened before the crash

278
00:17:00,739 --> 00:17:03,239
we know that there
was no fire on the aircraft

279
00:17:03,301 --> 00:17:06,704
so we believed that the solder
melted due the internal heating

280
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:08,778
but we don't know why

281
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,900
they then inspect
the right generator

282
00:17:14,023 --> 00:17:16,023
the banding wire
is intact in this one

283
00:17:17,978 --> 00:17:18,978
looks fine

284
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,500
we did a resistance test
check the brushes

285
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:25,103
and we looked at all the
mechanical working to the generator

286
00:17:25,658 --> 00:17:27,658
we were not able to
find any reason why

287
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,796
the right generator would
not charge the batteries

288
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:32,343
how did they crashed?

289
00:17:32,787 --> 00:17:35,510
with 4 working batteries
and one working generator

290
00:17:37,035 --> 00:17:39,335
from examination of the wreckage

291
00:17:39,581 --> 00:17:42,903
we were not able to find
any reason for the accident

292
00:17:44,103 --> 00:17:46,103
we were hoping the
the voice recorder

293
00:17:46,619 --> 00:17:48,839
would give us clues as
to what really happened

294
00:17:52,223 --> 00:17:54,784
the recording starts around
4 minutes after take off

295
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,979
investigators turned to flight
710's cockpit voice recorder

296
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:05,303
to determine how an aircraft with
one functioning generator crashed

297
00:18:06,345 --> 00:18:07,845
short of its destination

298
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:15,559
zero voltage and
amps on the left side

299
00:18:19,984 --> 00:18:21,684
just like we suspected

300
00:18:23,106 --> 00:18:27,863
the CVR recording confirms that the left
generator failed shortly after take off

301
00:18:30,104 --> 00:18:32,165
the right generator
is putting a 27.5 volts

302
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:35,346
but I can't get
it to come online

303
00:18:36,979 --> 00:18:38,879
investigators can't understand

304
00:18:38,982 --> 00:18:42,758
why the right generator was
disconnected from electrical system

305
00:18:42,903 --> 00:18:44,583
if it was operational

306
00:18:45,185 --> 00:18:47,339
then they hear an
astonishing statement

307
00:18:47,739 --> 00:18:49,761
from the first
officer to the captain

308
00:18:50,582 --> 00:18:51,882
when we lost the left one

309
00:18:51,938 --> 00:18:53,938
I reached up and shut
off the right generator

310
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,161
because I assume the
problem was the right side

311
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,302
isolating it now

312
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,842
there are two shut off
switches for the generators

313
00:19:04,663 --> 00:19:08,500
one for the left generators
and one for the right

314
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,640
the first officer
disconnects the right one

315
00:19:10,821 --> 00:19:13,243
to protect the rest of the
aircraft electrical system

316
00:19:15,626 --> 00:19:18,219
but he soon realizes that
it's the left one that has issue

317
00:19:19,221 --> 00:19:20,221
not the right

318
00:19:22,743 --> 00:19:24,743
why doesn't he
just reconnect it?

319
00:19:25,861 --> 00:19:26,861
he tries

320
00:19:27,301 --> 00:19:28,301
but it doesn't work

321
00:19:29,023 --> 00:19:31,123
the right generator was not
charging the batteries

322
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:33,799
so that we know all they
had to power the aircraft

323
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,062
was the charge remaining on
the battery shortly after take off

324
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,718
maybe there is a problem
with the switching unit

325
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,740
if the generator switching
unit doesn't working

326
00:19:44,222 --> 00:19:46,082
then the generator will
not come back online

327
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:49,154
so we were quite interested in learning
what we could about this component

328
00:19:53,863 --> 00:19:54,863
it's pretty rough shape

329
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,583
looking for signs
of a malfunction

330
00:19:57,866 --> 00:20:00,960
investigators examine the
right generator control switch

331
00:20:05,684 --> 00:20:07,184
I can't tell 100 percent

332
00:20:07,658 --> 00:20:09,681
it's possible it failed
before the crash

333
00:20:11,901 --> 00:20:14,122
the switching unit was
heavily damaged from the crash

334
00:20:14,221 --> 00:20:15,621
we were not able to determine

335
00:20:15,661 --> 00:20:19,053
if that's even why the
generator would not come online

336
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:26,323
even if the switch was broken, it
doesn't explain the pilot's actions

337
00:20:28,943 --> 00:20:30,443
the first officer says

338
00:20:30,665 --> 00:20:32,800
I assume the problem
was with the right side

339
00:20:34,261 --> 00:20:36,261
why would he assume
something like that?

340
00:20:36,782 --> 00:20:39,783
it made us wonder if there is a
problem with that generator in the past

341
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,589
take a look at this
maintenance reports

342
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:48,125
the team reviews the maintenance records
for the Hawker Siddeley's generators

343
00:20:48,584 --> 00:20:49,584
check it out

344
00:20:49,828 --> 00:20:53,340
no less than 8 separate pilot complains
and repairs on the right generator

345
00:20:55,978 --> 00:20:57,978
voltage fluctuations

346
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,540
recurring problems
at the regulator

347
00:21:01,104 --> 00:21:03,104
causing the right
generator to shut down

348
00:21:06,147 --> 00:21:07,947
two weeks before the crash

349
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:11,461
there were issues with the
right generator almost everyday

350
00:21:12,383 --> 00:21:13,983
they were doing maintenance

351
00:21:14,063 --> 00:21:15,763
they were troubleshooting it

352
00:21:15,786 --> 00:21:18,378
they were changing parts
and they couldn't fixed it

353
00:21:18,899 --> 00:21:23,142
air Illinois had one Hawker Siddeley
and 3 flight crews flying that plane

354
00:21:25,378 --> 00:21:27,078
I'm sure that they all knew that

355
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,372
the right generator had
had problems in the past

356
00:21:29,381 --> 00:21:31,463
they probably all experienced
at one time or another

357
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:36,420
the first officer had been
on some of those flights

358
00:21:36,423 --> 00:21:39,687
where the right generator
had actually disconnected

359
00:21:40,659 --> 00:21:42,159
thank goodness
I was not

360
00:21:46,702 --> 00:21:48,002
that would explain

361
00:21:48,064 --> 00:21:52,736
why the first officer disconnected
the right generator instead of left one

362
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,742
investigators suspect that
on the night of the crash

363
00:21:58,183 --> 00:21:59,783
it's the generator again

364
00:22:00,425 --> 00:22:02,861
the first officer made
the immediate assumption

365
00:22:02,899 --> 00:22:05,566
that the right generator
had malfunctioned

366
00:22:07,422 --> 00:22:11,440
the reaction that the first officer had
about taking the right generator offline

367
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:14,863
probably falls into a phenomenon
that's called expectation bias

368
00:22:15,582 --> 00:22:17,582
he has experiences in the past

369
00:22:18,384 --> 00:22:20,919
and assumed that was
going to be the problem

370
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,580
without really looking at the
indication that were available to him

371
00:22:25,661 --> 00:22:27,341
it still doesn't explain the crash

372
00:22:28,782 --> 00:22:30,782
even though both
generators were offline

373
00:22:31,344 --> 00:22:34,980
investigators know the aircraft's
batteries were in working order

374
00:22:36,382 --> 00:22:38,062
how are the batteries?

375
00:22:38,663 --> 00:22:39,663
pretty good

376
00:22:40,219 --> 00:22:41,219
they're at 21.5

377
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,500
should it last to Carbondale?

378
00:22:45,342 --> 00:22:46,342
yeah

379
00:22:46,544 --> 00:22:47,844
it was really important to know

380
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,801
did the batteries have enough
endurance to get to the airport?

381
00:22:54,943 --> 00:22:56,964
let's see how they
managed their battery power

382
00:22:58,018 --> 00:23:00,620
investigators return to
the cockpit voice recorder

383
00:23:02,061 --> 00:23:06,781
to determine why flight 710 run out of
battery power before reaching Carbondale

384
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:10,062
how are the batteries there?

385
00:23:12,303 --> 00:23:13,303
we're down to 22.5 volts

386
00:23:14,866 --> 00:23:15,866
okay

387
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:17,146
beacons off

388
00:23:17,868 --> 00:23:18,868
okay

389
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,780
nav lights are off

390
00:23:23,065 --> 00:23:26,061
just minutes after discovering
both generators are down

391
00:23:26,419 --> 00:23:28,382
the pilots turn off
non essential systems

392
00:23:28,941 --> 00:23:29,941
to save their batteries

393
00:23:33,661 --> 00:23:35,261
they're doing the right thing

394
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,380
turning things
off to reduce load

395
00:23:38,223 --> 00:23:39,223
but is it enough?

396
00:23:42,701 --> 00:23:46,280
according to the manufacture, they
needed to reduce the load to 70 amps

397
00:23:48,259 --> 00:23:50,542
amps measure the strength
of an electrical current

398
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:53,264
the more amps drawn on a battery

399
00:23:53,859 --> 00:23:55,860
the faster the
battery will discharge

400
00:23:57,262 --> 00:23:59,321
if the crew would have
reduced the load to 70 amps

401
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:02,480
that would have given them
minimum of 30 minutes of endurance

402
00:24:02,861 --> 00:24:06,060
that might have been enough time
to get them to the Carbondale airport

403
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:09,642
let's see if they got their
load down to 70 amps

404
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,264
well

405
00:24:12,947 --> 00:24:14,947
we know they
turned off the beacons

406
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,060
navigation lights

407
00:24:18,062 --> 00:24:20,062
investigators make an inventory

408
00:24:20,139 --> 00:24:23,222
of the instruments the crew
turned off and what they left on

409
00:24:23,822 --> 00:24:26,801
in order to calculate
the load on the batteries

410
00:24:28,501 --> 00:24:29,501
what else?

411
00:24:31,301 --> 00:24:33,301
are you using these lights here?

412
00:24:33,861 --> 00:24:35,361
I'll get that one down

413
00:24:36,102 --> 00:24:39,180
we were not able to determine
what was powered up or

414
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,400
on or off based on
the flight recorder

415
00:24:42,702 --> 00:24:44,502
should it last to Carbondale?

416
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,740
so we had to rely on the
conversations between the two pilots

417
00:24:48,021 --> 00:24:50,024
what to leave on
and what to turn off

418
00:24:59,224 --> 00:25:00,424
DME instruments

419
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,940
weather radar

420
00:25:03,422 --> 00:25:04,422
main cabin lights

421
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:07,539
one of the main radios

422
00:25:08,221 --> 00:25:09,221
cooling fan

423
00:25:11,059 --> 00:25:12,059
and the transponder

424
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:16,103
the weather radar and the
radios draw a lot of power

425
00:25:17,023 --> 00:25:20,540
and so shedding those if you
can is a prudent thing to do

426
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:24,283
looks like they kept the rest
of the flight instruments on and

427
00:25:24,382 --> 00:25:25,382
that's it

428
00:25:30,578 --> 00:25:32,078
they used a 110 amps

429
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:38,060
investigators discover the crew did not
properly reduce the drew on their batteries

430
00:25:39,782 --> 00:25:41,858
I wonder they didn't
make it to the Carbondale

431
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,902
this important with load shedding
and getting down to 70 amps

432
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:48,462
seems to be lost on the crew

433
00:25:48,864 --> 00:25:52,541
as there seems to be no discussion
whatsoever about amperage to determine

434
00:25:53,062 --> 00:25:57,462
if their changes in electrical system
were actually making a difference

435
00:25:57,645 --> 00:25:59,645
and the longevity
of the batteries

436
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:05,542
so why did the pilots believed they had
enough power to reach their destination

437
00:26:07,785 --> 00:26:11,580
the team checks to see how the
pilots monitored the state of the batteries

438
00:26:12,861 --> 00:26:16,361
says here fully charged
the batteries is at 24 volts

439
00:26:17,024 --> 00:26:18,524
let's see how they did

440
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,940
how are the batteries there?

441
00:26:26,904 --> 00:26:28,404
we're down to 22.5 volts

442
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:34,462
8 minutes into the flight
they used up 1.5 volts

443
00:26:38,186 --> 00:26:39,686
7 minutes later

444
00:26:41,027 --> 00:26:42,527
how are the batteries?

445
00:26:43,581 --> 00:26:44,581
pretty good

446
00:26:45,221 --> 00:26:46,261
they're at 21.5

447
00:26:46,902 --> 00:26:48,902
the battery charge
drops another volt

448
00:26:49,184 --> 00:26:50,184
to 21.5

449
00:26:55,343 --> 00:26:58,379
the first officer says the
battery should last to Carbondale

450
00:27:00,141 --> 00:27:02,641
they're half way through the flight
he's feeling good

451
00:27:03,263 --> 00:27:05,763
and then 9 minutes later
he checks again

452
00:27:06,339 --> 00:27:07,339
it's 20 volts

453
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:15,459
so they think
they're doing alright

454
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,140
and then minutes later
the radios go dead

455
00:27:22,866 --> 00:27:25,366
we're losing everything
down to 30 volts

456
00:27:26,539 --> 00:27:29,039
they're talking
about having 20 volt

457
00:27:29,342 --> 00:27:32,202
and then they all of a
sudden they have 30 volt

458
00:27:32,938 --> 00:27:34,938
so they're monitoring the volt

459
00:27:34,941 --> 00:27:37,501
but it's as if the sudden
drop caught them by surprise

460
00:27:38,403 --> 00:27:41,078
the reason this is significant
is because Ni-Ca batteries

461
00:27:41,418 --> 00:27:46,502
will maintain their voltage almost right
until the end that the batteries are dead

462
00:27:47,344 --> 00:27:49,944
much different than
Lead-acid batteries

463
00:27:50,139 --> 00:27:53,403
which is where you see a
gradual decline in voltage

464
00:27:56,344 --> 00:27:58,844
that characteristic
of Ni-Ca batteries

465
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:02,804
may explain why there was such a
sudden drop in the battery voltage

466
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:06,744
I don't know if we have
enough juice to get out of this

467
00:28:07,307 --> 00:28:10,442
if they would have known the
characteristic of the Ni-Ca battery

468
00:28:10,941 --> 00:28:12,902
it might've sent them
a message saying

469
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:15,942
we better get on this right away
get this low reduce

470
00:28:17,141 --> 00:28:20,641
investigators find another reason
why the crew may have missed

471
00:28:20,823 --> 00:28:22,964
how fast their batteries
will discharging

472
00:28:23,665 --> 00:28:25,665
they never mentioned their amps

473
00:28:27,019 --> 00:28:29,642
looks like the only thing
they monitored were the volts

474
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,740
volt measure the potential
output of the battery

475
00:28:34,299 --> 00:28:35,299
not how long it will last

476
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:39,083
amps tell you how much
electricity is being drawn

477
00:28:39,978 --> 00:28:43,060
it was very surprising that they
weren't monitoring the amperage

478
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:46,803
because that was going to tell them
how much longer they had on the batteries

479
00:28:47,944 --> 00:28:52,180
did the crew have the proper training to
monitor the endurance of the batteries?

480
00:28:57,505 --> 00:29:00,600
investigators interview
other air Illinois pilots

481
00:29:01,141 --> 00:29:02,141
so what did you find out?

482
00:29:02,581 --> 00:29:05,984
to determine their ability to monitor
and calculate battery endurance

483
00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:10,299
well

484
00:29:10,461 --> 00:29:14,123
we know that they're all trained on battery
management for a dual generator problem

485
00:29:14,143 --> 00:29:15,143
but

486
00:29:16,105 --> 00:29:19,739
when I ask them how long they thought
the battery would have last on the flight

487
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:22,099
some calculated 30 minutes

488
00:29:22,381 --> 00:29:23,381
others

489
00:29:23,822 --> 00:29:24,822
less than an hour

490
00:29:26,103 --> 00:29:28,145
five pilots gave us
five different answers

491
00:29:28,579 --> 00:29:30,579
and they were not all correct

492
00:29:31,701 --> 00:29:35,263
that became obvious to us there was
definitely a training issue involved here

493
00:29:35,944 --> 00:29:37,345
are you using these lights here?

494
00:29:38,506 --> 00:29:39,506
I'll get that one down

495
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,940
the lack of training explains

496
00:29:43,061 --> 00:29:47,157
why the pilots thought they had
enough power to reach Carbondale

497
00:29:47,864 --> 00:29:49,864
but that doesn't
solve a bigger mystery

498
00:29:53,501 --> 00:29:54,501
this is their flight path

499
00:29:54,943 --> 00:29:57,903
why didn't the pilots land
the plane at another airport?

500
00:29:58,304 --> 00:30:00,565
before completely
running out of battery power

501
00:30:01,394 --> 00:30:05,582
one, two, three, four,
five different airports

502
00:30:07,023 --> 00:30:09,023
they were only five minutes
away from Springfield

503
00:30:09,078 --> 00:30:11,721
yet they elected to go
40 minutes to Carbondale

504
00:30:12,422 --> 00:30:14,961
and there were several airports
in between that they missed

505
00:30:15,783 --> 00:30:17,844
they could have landed
anytime along the way

506
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:22,822
their decision not to land caused
the pilots judgments into question

507
00:30:24,783 --> 00:30:27,284
it's time to look into
their backgrounds

508
00:30:33,182 --> 00:30:35,182
here is the captain's file

509
00:30:35,464 --> 00:30:38,860
investigators dig into the
backgrounds of flight 710 pilots

510
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:43,503
for clues that explain their unusual
reaction to an electrical failure

511
00:30:46,465 --> 00:30:48,739
the captain was
perfectly qualified

512
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:50,860
same with the FO

513
00:30:53,543 --> 00:30:54,543
gear up

514
00:30:54,823 --> 00:30:59,320
the two pilots were among the most
experienced flight crew on the roster

515
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,360
gear is up

516
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,784
with the combined 5000 flying hours
between them on the Hawker Siddeley

517
00:31:06,858 --> 00:31:07,858
here is something

518
00:31:08,581 --> 00:31:10,581
the captain lived in Carbondale

519
00:31:12,259 --> 00:31:13,259
maybe he wanted get home

520
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:18,080
in aviation what we describe
as get home itis is when

521
00:31:18,145 --> 00:31:23,220
we try to make it to the destination
because of our strong desire to do so

522
00:31:24,303 --> 00:31:27,424
and get place a significant
role in our decision making

523
00:31:29,091 --> 00:31:31,541
investigators talk to
other pilots of the company

524
00:31:32,541 --> 00:31:34,141
including first officer
Jeanene Urban

525
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:37,241
how well did you
know the pilots?

526
00:31:38,901 --> 00:31:40,301
I flew with the captain

527
00:31:40,362 --> 00:31:42,362
I was get friends
with the first officer

528
00:31:44,781 --> 00:31:48,420
I thought very highly
of the first officer Frank

529
00:31:49,821 --> 00:31:51,821
I knew the flight
attendant Barbie

530
00:31:52,662 --> 00:31:54,162
and liked her a lot

531
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:59,663
it was a very emotional thing that
hear that both of them had been killed

532
00:32:02,184 --> 00:32:03,784
what sort of pilot
was the captain?

533
00:32:05,539 --> 00:32:07,439
I'd say average

534
00:32:08,381 --> 00:32:12,559
in aviation community when someone
is characterized as an average pilot

535
00:32:12,579 --> 00:32:14,640
that usually means
he's not too good

536
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,700
why is that?

537
00:32:17,782 --> 00:32:20,782
the captain really prided
himself on getting there on time

538
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:25,723
it was not uncommon
for him to take risks

539
00:32:28,345 --> 00:32:30,045
looks like we've
got some weather

540
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:31,559
shall I call for deviation?

541
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,060
it doesn't look too bad

542
00:32:34,583 --> 00:32:35,623
we'll be fine

543
00:32:38,264 --> 00:32:39,964
according to air Illinois pilots

544
00:32:40,499 --> 00:32:42,399
the captain would
often fly too close

545
00:32:42,701 --> 00:32:46,383
or through dangerous
storms to save flight time

546
00:32:48,624 --> 00:32:52,282
if I made any
comments or suggestions

547
00:32:54,062 --> 00:32:56,905
about a safety issue like the
thunderstorm or anything else

548
00:32:57,984 --> 00:32:59,984
he would do something spiteful

549
00:33:00,739 --> 00:33:03,339
just to prove that
he was the captain

550
00:33:04,943 --> 00:33:07,443
in order to keep schedule
he'd also speed up

551
00:33:07,501 --> 00:33:09,661
which would set off
the over speed alarm

552
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:15,324
pull the circuit breaker
would you?

553
00:33:15,379 --> 00:33:16,379
what?

554
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:17,820
really

555
00:33:18,942 --> 00:33:22,064
pilots said he would ordered them
to disable the over speed warning

556
00:33:22,624 --> 00:33:24,624
so that they could fly faster

557
00:33:26,261 --> 00:33:27,961
it was always about
getting there faster

558
00:33:30,983 --> 00:33:32,904
the captain behavior
is troublesome

559
00:33:35,421 --> 00:33:38,763
we wanted to know if
the company the airline

560
00:33:38,822 --> 00:33:42,219
was putting undue pressure on
the pilots to make the schedule

561
00:33:43,061 --> 00:33:45,961
this pressure to get there on time
was it from management?

562
00:33:47,103 --> 00:33:48,103
no

563
00:33:48,218 --> 00:33:49,218
it was all the captain

564
00:33:50,221 --> 00:33:52,421
the interviews with the
other pilots indicated

565
00:33:52,461 --> 00:33:54,743
that there was no undue
pressure to skirt the rules

566
00:33:55,865 --> 00:33:57,165
in the case of captain

567
00:33:57,258 --> 00:33:59,258
that pressure was self imposed

568
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:03,582
investigators conclude that captain
Smith often stretched the rules

569
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,159
what about the first officer?

570
00:34:09,582 --> 00:34:11,582
Frank was the best

571
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:15,780
and he knew the plane
and its systems very well

572
00:34:17,502 --> 00:34:19,902
so why didn't the
first officer speak up

573
00:34:20,064 --> 00:34:22,759
when captain Smith made
the decision to carry on

574
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:24,980
Illinois 710

575
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,721
do you intend to
return to Springfield?

576
00:34:27,022 --> 00:34:29,823
negative, continuing to
Carbondale, 3000 feet

577
00:34:32,021 --> 00:34:34,221
in a no time did we
hear the first officer

578
00:34:34,301 --> 00:34:36,501
challenge the captain's
decision to go into Carbondale

579
00:34:36,543 --> 00:34:38,543
we found this very perplexing

580
00:34:38,824 --> 00:34:41,940
I asked how he could fly with the
captain because he took so many chances

581
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,060
and he said all I just

582
00:34:46,583 --> 00:34:49,583
try to keep an eye on the
situation and not let him

583
00:34:49,606 --> 00:34:51,792
get us into anything
that I can't get us out of

584
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:55,720
we're losing everything
down to 30 volts

585
00:34:55,863 --> 00:34:56,863
watch my altitude frank

586
00:34:58,424 --> 00:35:00,524
well that didn't
workout very well at all

587
00:35:01,861 --> 00:35:04,982
the captain should have made the decision
to return to the Springfield airport

588
00:35:05,823 --> 00:35:07,860
and if so, none of this
would have happened

589
00:35:11,141 --> 00:35:12,141
thank you

590
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:16,265
investigators conclude
that the risk taking captain

591
00:35:16,539 --> 00:35:18,619
and a non-assertive
first officer

592
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:21,060
was a dangerous combination

593
00:35:22,182 --> 00:35:23,182
let's pick it up

594
00:35:23,624 --> 00:35:27,080
from where they realize they don't have
enough power to make it to Carbondale

595
00:35:27,299 --> 00:35:30,462
the team returns to the
cockpit voice recording

596
00:35:31,263 --> 00:35:34,945
to see if they can uncover why
the plane ended up so far off course

597
00:35:37,179 --> 00:35:38,179
watch my altitude

598
00:35:38,621 --> 00:35:40,121
going down to 2400 feet

599
00:35:41,704 --> 00:35:42,704
okay

600
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,540
stop the tape

601
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:49,341
why would the captain decide
to drop down to 2400 feet?

602
00:35:53,859 --> 00:35:57,359
the cloud ceiling near
Carbondale was almost 2,000 feet

603
00:35:57,541 --> 00:36:00,341
so maybe he was
popping in out of the clouds

604
00:36:00,383 --> 00:36:02,364
to see something on the ground

605
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,500
play on

606
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:09,983
have you got a flash light?

607
00:36:10,025 --> 00:36:11,025
yeah

608
00:36:12,386 --> 00:36:13,386
here we go

609
00:36:13,479 --> 00:36:15,479
you wanna shine it up here

610
00:36:16,021 --> 00:36:18,101
just as the captain
tries to see the ground

611
00:36:18,583 --> 00:36:20,083
the cockpit lights go out

612
00:36:20,865 --> 00:36:22,865
and plunge them
into total darkness

613
00:36:23,986 --> 00:36:25,987
we're losing everything
down to 30 volts

614
00:36:28,781 --> 00:36:30,281
watch my altitude Frank

615
00:36:33,331 --> 00:36:34,331
okay

616
00:36:34,504 --> 00:36:35,504
2400

617
00:36:38,301 --> 00:36:39,801
they make it to 2400 feet

618
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:42,550
and captain plans to level off

619
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:46,540
spot the runway and
continue his descent

620
00:36:47,103 --> 00:36:49,103
but that's not what happens

621
00:36:49,907 --> 00:36:52,186
okay, you're banking left
6 degrees

622
00:36:53,859 --> 00:36:55,659
okay correcting to the right

623
00:36:56,421 --> 00:36:59,543
just minutes later, they ended up crashing
in completely the opposite direction

624
00:37:00,104 --> 00:37:01,104
a little more

625
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:03,900
so the question is
what happened?

626
00:37:09,987 --> 00:37:12,421
how did they go from
leveling off at 2400 feet

627
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:15,001
to then hitting the ground
in the opposite direction?

628
00:37:16,823 --> 00:37:20,508
investigators examine the
final moments of flight 710

629
00:37:21,059 --> 00:37:24,080
to determine what ultimately
brought the plane down

630
00:37:24,821 --> 00:37:26,821
how does the recording end?

631
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,320
the recording eerily slows down

632
00:37:41,138 --> 00:37:42,138
and then

633
00:37:42,579 --> 00:37:43,579
silence

634
00:37:45,141 --> 00:37:46,141
the batteries just died

635
00:37:51,362 --> 00:37:53,580
the captain is asking
for a horizon reading

636
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:56,881
on the attitude
directional indicator (ADI)

637
00:37:59,419 --> 00:38:02,219
the ADI uses an
electrically power gyroscopic

638
00:38:02,262 --> 00:38:04,342
to indicate the
aircraft's pitch and roll

639
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:06,783
relative to the earth horizon

640
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:09,639
it's night time

641
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,900
indiscernible horizon
low visibility

642
00:38:13,782 --> 00:38:18,299
your ADI is everything that you need to
be able to keep the airplane wings level

643
00:38:20,141 --> 00:38:22,422
it lost the lights on
their instruments

644
00:38:23,543 --> 00:38:25,543
some of them
are starting to fail

645
00:38:27,899 --> 00:38:33,580
he asked the first officer
to shine a light on their ADI

646
00:38:34,661 --> 00:38:37,683
okay, you banked left
6 degrees

647
00:38:38,345 --> 00:38:40,345
okay
correcting to the right

648
00:38:41,139 --> 00:38:44,822
investigators can only
surmise what happened next

649
00:38:45,383 --> 00:38:47,378
even if all the
instruments had failed

650
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,701
the ADI would still
look like it's working

651
00:38:51,859 --> 00:38:55,662
the ADI gyroscope
spins at about 15,000 rpm

652
00:38:56,939 --> 00:38:58,939
even after the power shuts down

653
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:01,182
it will continue rotating
for several minutes

654
00:39:02,904 --> 00:39:04,945
so look like it's working
but it really is not

655
00:39:06,587 --> 00:39:08,187
as the ADI winds down

656
00:39:08,587 --> 00:39:10,587
it slowly tilts to one side

657
00:39:11,701 --> 00:39:16,225
imagine that ADI starts
slowly falling to left

658
00:39:18,741 --> 00:39:20,522
he correct by
rolling to the right

659
00:39:23,264 --> 00:39:25,384
okay, you banked left
6 degrees

660
00:39:27,219 --> 00:39:28,999
okay, correcting to the right

661
00:39:32,022 --> 00:39:33,062
a little more

662
00:39:34,584 --> 00:39:37,644
it may have appeared to them
that the ADI was working correctly

663
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,701
but they're really banking
to the right losing altitude

664
00:39:41,944 --> 00:39:43,899
they probably
followed that failing ADI

665
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,761
right into the ground

666
00:39:49,583 --> 00:39:52,464
they couldn't see where they are
they couldn't see any lights and

667
00:39:52,706 --> 00:39:54,406
it would be over an instant

668
00:40:08,142 --> 00:40:09,142
in the final report

669
00:40:09,862 --> 00:40:12,562
investigators conclude
that the fatal accident

670
00:40:12,621 --> 00:40:17,383
was a consequence of the captain's decision
to continue the flight toward Carbondale

671
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:21,781
instead of returning to the nearby
departure airport after the lost of power

672
00:40:22,903 --> 00:40:26,003
the cause of this accident
was not a catastrophic failure

673
00:40:26,024 --> 00:40:28,025
that suddenly cause
the airplane to crash

674
00:40:29,146 --> 00:40:31,179
it was the decision
by the captain

675
00:40:31,699 --> 00:40:33,799
to continue flight
on battery power

676
00:40:33,981 --> 00:40:35,981
after they lost the generators

677
00:40:37,383 --> 00:40:40,466
also adding to the problem was a
lack of crew resource management

678
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:42,339
or CRM

679
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:47,983
no part of crew resource
management training is that

680
00:40:48,124 --> 00:40:51,170
crews are trained
to act as a team

681
00:40:51,499 --> 00:40:54,399
and first officers are
taught and encourage

682
00:40:54,861 --> 00:40:59,858
to question the captain's decision
making and actions, if they do not agree

683
00:41:00,795 --> 00:41:01,795
speak up

684
00:41:01,899 --> 00:41:04,999
don't worry about if it
upsets somebody ego

685
00:41:05,003 --> 00:41:06,503
it's not worth dying over

686
00:41:07,823 --> 00:41:10,323
investigators site
inadequate crew training

687
00:41:10,346 --> 00:41:14,058
to assess battery endurance
as another contributing factor

688
00:41:15,142 --> 00:41:17,442
it should have been
discussed in their training

689
00:41:17,703 --> 00:41:19,919
it should have been
in their training materials

690
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,260
and in the flight manual

691
00:41:22,261 --> 00:41:23,861
as a result of this accident

692
00:41:23,942 --> 00:41:27,904
the NTSB also recommends
independently powered ADIs

693
00:41:28,466 --> 00:41:29,966
on all transport airplanes

694
00:41:30,979 --> 00:41:32,879
so that if all power was lost

695
00:41:32,903 --> 00:41:34,023
they still had the ability

696
00:41:34,062 --> 00:41:36,674
to keep the airplane straight
level for at least 30 minutes

697
00:41:37,944 --> 00:41:41,127
this recommendation
was implemented in 1997

698
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:46,699
flight 710 brought
national attention

699
00:41:46,942 --> 00:41:49,950
and increased scrutiny
of small commuter airlines

700
00:41:51,465 --> 00:41:53,006
six month after the accident

701
00:41:53,299 --> 00:41:55,299
air Illinois filed for bankruptcy

702
00:41:55,821 --> 00:41:56,821
and ceased operations

703
00:41:57,823 --> 00:41:58,823
it's something we

704
00:41:59,284 --> 00:42:00,284
we learn by our mistakes

705
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:03,245
the first priority is the
safety of the passengers

706
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:06,340
is gotta be the
most important factor
