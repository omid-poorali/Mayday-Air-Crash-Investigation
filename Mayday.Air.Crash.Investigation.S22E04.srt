1
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:09,582
an emergency above the french
Alps strikes trans air cargo flight 671

2
00:00:10,662 --> 00:00:14,461
there was a enormous bang
and the aircraft almost inverted

3
00:00:16,302 --> 00:00:18,302
mayday mayday mayday mayday

4
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:21,083
the crew needs to
land but are flying blind

5
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,620
kabo 671
we have no radar contact

6
00:00:25,461 --> 00:00:28,024
they stood a very real
chance of hitting a mountain

7
00:00:28,864 --> 00:00:31,540
then they discover
something even more horrifying

8
00:00:35,062 --> 00:00:38,144
I saw nothing in the
number 4 engine position

9
00:00:39,025 --> 00:00:40,025
the wing is clean

10
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,420
assuming the worse

11
00:00:41,861 --> 00:00:44,440
the first officer leaves
a clue for investigators

12
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:48,522
I took the photograph
because I wasn't sure

13
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,660
what would happen next

14
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,280
if somebody might
find the camera

15
00:00:52,442 --> 00:00:53,442
they see the truth

16
00:01:20,059 --> 00:01:25,423
trans air flight 671 is preparing
for take off at Luxembourg airport

17
00:01:27,665 --> 00:01:29,665
forecast says we'll get
some weather about an hour

18
00:01:30,782 --> 00:01:32,482
that's crossover the alps

19
00:01:32,742 --> 00:01:33,742
typical

20
00:01:34,462 --> 00:01:38,601
captain Ingemar Berglund is
highly experienced Swedish pilot

21
00:01:38,701 --> 00:01:42,103
who’s has been flying Boeing
707 aircraft for over a decade

22
00:01:43,785 --> 00:01:45,785
the captain had
been a military pilot

23
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:50,022
and he'd been on air transport
flying for most of his working life

24
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:52,663
these experience
was pretty vast in Africa

25
00:01:53,665 --> 00:01:55,305
and in Europe
he knew the routes

26
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:56,959
and he was a very good pilot

27
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,023
kabo 671
you're clear for take off

28
00:02:00,702 --> 00:02:01,702
runway 24

29
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,600
671
clear for take off

30
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,620
roger

31
00:02:07,463 --> 00:02:09,063
first officer Martin Emery

32
00:02:09,584 --> 00:02:10,924
is an accomplished British pilot

33
00:02:10,984 --> 00:02:13,760
who has work as an instructor
and an air traffic controller

34
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:16,501
ready to go

35
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:24,443
the first officer had
about 10,000 hours

36
00:02:24,462 --> 00:02:26,423
about half of which
was on the Boeing 707

37
00:02:27,023 --> 00:02:28,523
so he was very experienced too

38
00:02:32,642 --> 00:02:34,180
170

39
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:35,904
rotate

40
00:02:39,547 --> 00:02:41,947
the Boeing 707 is
a long range aircraft

41
00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:44,940
powered by 4 Pratt
& Whitney engines

42
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,420
it was a very basic airplane

43
00:02:49,582 --> 00:02:51,682
very strong
very reliable

44
00:02:51,859 --> 00:02:54,359
and could carry 40
or 50 tons of freight

45
00:02:57,463 --> 00:03:00,025
assisting the pilots is
flight engineer Terry Boone

46
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:06,759
the Boeing 707 didn't have much
in the way of automated systems

47
00:03:07,863 --> 00:03:10,763
but this meant that
there was a whole panel

48
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:13,065
side ways in the flight deck

49
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:17,102
in which the flight engineer had
to operate every system manually

50
00:03:18,624 --> 00:03:23,720
he was probably one the most experienced
Boeing 707 flight engineers in the world

51
00:03:25,942 --> 00:03:30,138
today's flight is 7 hour journey
from Luxembourg to Kano Nigeria

52
00:03:35,463 --> 00:03:37,063
feels a little heavy today

53
00:03:37,985 --> 00:03:40,185
do you see what's
loaded back there?

54
00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:41,579
so oil equipment

55
00:03:41,742 --> 00:03:43,422
yeah
not the light kind

56
00:03:44,883 --> 00:03:49,947
flight 671 is operated by the newly
formed Nigeria company Trans Air Limited

57
00:03:51,067 --> 00:03:52,567
their client
Kabo air cargo

58
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,702
Trans Air had only been formed
a few weeks before this incident

59
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:02,126
used purely for the
oil industry transport

60
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:05,500
a lot of equipment down
to Nigeria for the oil works

61
00:04:06,902 --> 00:04:08,902
this was an extra special flight

62
00:04:08,903 --> 00:04:12,306
in that it was carrying equipment that
would have helped Nigeria in modernizing

63
00:04:15,939 --> 00:04:19,523
kabo 671 levels
off at 29,000 feet

64
00:04:24,106 --> 00:04:27,200
the flight ban indicated
with the weight to the aircraft

65
00:04:27,379 --> 00:04:29,402
we should stay at a
slightly low at the normal

66
00:04:30,221 --> 00:04:32,745
flight level for the
first part of the flight

67
00:04:32,745 --> 00:04:33,745
until we burned off fuel

68
00:04:34,184 --> 00:04:36,126
and then we could
gain a higher flight level

69
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,660
how are the guys in the back?

70
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,740
good
made us coffee

71
00:04:41,302 --> 00:04:43,742
also on board are
a cargo supervisor

72
00:04:43,824 --> 00:04:45,524
and the maintenance engineer

73
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:47,386
like them more everyday

74
00:04:49,251 --> 00:04:51,980
so the five of them were
knowledgeable about the 707

75
00:04:52,581 --> 00:04:57,064
they were knowledgeable about
this sort of ad-hoc air cargo word

76
00:04:57,384 --> 00:05:00,120
although they hadn't met
until a 4:00 night previously

77
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:02,159
I think they work well
together as a team

78
00:05:04,943 --> 00:05:05,943
over the alps

79
00:05:06,378 --> 00:05:08,458
the weather deteriorates

80
00:05:10,621 --> 00:05:13,464
pretty much ground level
up to about 33000 feet

81
00:05:14,258 --> 00:05:15,758
was in cloud

82
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,220
and the cloud was
rough and turbulent

83
00:05:21,865 --> 00:05:23,904
I'm gonna buckle
up until we're above it

84
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:25,425
good idea

85
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,620
we engaged our five seat harness

86
00:05:30,461 --> 00:05:34,461
rather than just the 4 point harnesses
that we normally keep on to a top of climb

87
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,584
and then moved
down seats forward

88
00:05:36,638 --> 00:05:39,180
to be really guarding the
control in this turbulent air

89
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,720
it was getting quite rough

90
00:05:41,223 --> 00:05:42,223
ask if we can go to 33

91
00:05:44,619 --> 00:05:45,619
kabo 671

92
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,820
request flight level 330

93
00:05:50,499 --> 00:05:52,899
671 roger
climb to flight level 330

94
00:05:54,702 --> 00:05:56,202
climb 330
671

95
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,682
the requested climb
was to go up another 4000

96
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:13,980
one hour into the flight

97
00:06:14,702 --> 00:06:16,202
just as the plane
reaches 33000 feet

98
00:06:23,701 --> 00:06:26,301
there was a enormous bang

99
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,153
followed almost
immediately by another one

100
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:33,382
and the aircraft
absolutely rolled to the right

101
00:06:43,383 --> 00:06:46,064
the captain uses all his
strength to level the plane

102
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:51,021
have the captain not
reacted as quickly as he did

103
00:06:51,261 --> 00:06:52,961
the aircraft could
have rolled over

104
00:06:53,544 --> 00:06:54,544
in fact inverted

105
00:06:56,658 --> 00:06:57,658
engine fire

106
00:06:59,181 --> 00:07:00,881
engine 3 and 4
show signs of fire

107
00:07:04,784 --> 00:07:07,367
while the flight engineer
deals with the engine alarm

108
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,120
the first officer
checks on the engines

109
00:07:15,179 --> 00:07:18,301
I saw nothing in the
number 4 engine position

110
00:07:19,702 --> 00:07:21,702
number 4 engine
has left the wing

111
00:07:26,723 --> 00:07:28,799
mayday mayday mayday
kabo 671

112
00:07:29,941 --> 00:07:33,344
with reduced engine power
and an unbalanced configuration

113
00:07:33,904 --> 00:07:36,904
the flight drops out of the
sky in an uncontrolled descent

114
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:40,219
the descent rate was horrific

115
00:07:40,482 --> 00:07:43,082
I think I saw 8 or 9
thousand feet per minute

116
00:07:45,325 --> 00:07:48,826
it's diving quickly towards the
french alps through heavy cloud

117
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:53,859
they need to get out
of the mountains and

118
00:07:54,262 --> 00:07:56,543
they can't see outside
because of the thick cloud

119
00:07:58,459 --> 00:08:01,581
they need the air traffic
controller to give them a direction

120
00:08:01,862 --> 00:08:04,962
in which to head for a safe
heaven for a safe airborne

121
00:08:07,747 --> 00:08:11,327
mayday mayday mayday
request descent for radar landing

122
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:15,662
the ground service can follow
your track over the ground

123
00:08:15,722 --> 00:08:18,283
your heading, height and
speed from a transponder

124
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,280
they can point you to the
nearest available runway

125
00:08:23,623 --> 00:08:25,779
but air traffic
control had bad news

126
00:08:31,784 --> 00:08:34,284
kabo 671
we have no radar contact

127
00:08:34,346 --> 00:08:36,213
say your position please sir

128
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,939
they can no longer see
flight 671 on the radar

129
00:08:41,422 --> 00:08:44,826
with no body able to give
them a direction to steer

130
00:08:45,105 --> 00:08:47,726
they stood a very real
chance of hitting a mountain

131
00:08:49,581 --> 00:08:51,581
the plane's radar
transponder has failed

132
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,942
I was considering which direction
we could go to avoid the mountains

133
00:09:04,463 --> 00:09:05,963
it was very scary

134
00:09:13,461 --> 00:09:18,499
the situation is dire enough that the first
officer records the damage to the wing

135
00:09:21,062 --> 00:09:23,563
I wasn't sure what
would happened next

136
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:26,464
I believe if anything ended

137
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,900
like the flight before
we were ready

138
00:09:29,581 --> 00:09:32,208
somebody might find the
camera and then they see the truth

139
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:43,739
flight 671 is on an uncontrolled
descent over the french alps

140
00:09:43,741 --> 00:09:47,081
with thick cloud and no transponder
for the controller to guide them

141
00:09:47,383 --> 00:09:48,883
the crew is flying blind

142
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:52,399
mayday mayday mayday
request descent for radar landing

143
00:09:56,665 --> 00:10:00,186
the flight engineer attempts to
get the transponder working again

144
00:10:00,619 --> 00:10:02,619
he suspects there
is a power issue

145
00:10:04,001 --> 00:10:07,001
the reason the air traffic
control lost the radar initially

146
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:11,083
was probably because
the electrics power in the radar

147
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:14,340
failed when engine
number 4 fell off

148
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:20,185
the flight engineer redirects
the power to engine 1

149
00:10:21,939 --> 00:10:25,539
he selected the essential
power selector to engine 1

150
00:10:25,582 --> 00:10:28,449
which had an operative
electrical generator

151
00:10:30,946 --> 00:10:31,946
it works

152
00:10:32,211 --> 00:10:33,811
request descent
radar landing

153
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,220
roger

154
00:10:35,782 --> 00:10:37,782
turn left heading
south to Marseille

155
00:10:38,307 --> 00:10:41,907
the controller direct flight
671 to Marseille airport

156
00:10:42,101 --> 00:10:43,601
75 miles away

157
00:10:45,225 --> 00:10:46,725
you turn left 180

158
00:10:47,745 --> 00:10:48,745
okay

159
00:10:53,623 --> 00:10:56,765
there was a immense relief
as they descended out of cloud

160
00:10:57,264 --> 00:10:59,766
and finally could see the
mountains around them

161
00:11:00,387 --> 00:11:02,087
but relief is short lived

162
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:06,196
after the first officer gives the
right wing a further inspection

163
00:11:10,501 --> 00:11:12,581
we've lost both
engines on the right wing

164
00:11:12,584 --> 00:11:13,584
what?

165
00:11:15,386 --> 00:11:17,886
with the 5 point harness
you're slightly restricted

166
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:20,999
but I did managed to look
right of my right shoulder

167
00:11:21,022 --> 00:11:23,122
and both the engines
were off the wing

168
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,182
the wing was clean

169
00:11:24,344 --> 00:11:26,344
which was a really big shock

170
00:11:27,738 --> 00:11:28,738
we've lost both engines

171
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,900
both engines

172
00:11:31,461 --> 00:11:34,523
just about the worst thing
that can happen in an airliner

173
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:36,985
is to have an engine
depart from the aircraft

174
00:11:38,179 --> 00:11:42,741
the only thing worse than that would be to
have two engines depart from your aircraft

175
00:11:43,783 --> 00:11:46,283
with only the two left
engines functioning

176
00:11:46,618 --> 00:11:48,318
control of the plane
is compromised

177
00:11:50,822 --> 00:11:53,399
when you've lost both
engines from the right wing

178
00:11:53,941 --> 00:11:57,001
and still have a lot of thrust
from the engines on the left wing

179
00:11:57,344 --> 00:11:59,744
it'd upsets that balance
and cause the airplane

180
00:11:59,904 --> 00:12:03,940
to turn and to roll very
powerfully to the right

181
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:07,459
getting the airplane to turn left

182
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,721
is a huge ask under
these circumstances

183
00:12:12,143 --> 00:12:13,143
you turn 180

184
00:12:13,304 --> 00:12:14,304
yeah

185
00:12:14,979 --> 00:12:15,979
I'm trying

186
00:12:19,742 --> 00:12:22,784
flying the disabled plane is
testing the captain strength

187
00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:29,959
the Boeing 707 has all
manual flying controls

188
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:32,982
it's very heavy to fly
when everything working well

189
00:12:33,705 --> 00:12:35,866
when you've lost two
engines on one side

190
00:12:36,002 --> 00:12:40,041
it's virtually at the limit of
physical capability for the captain

191
00:12:45,505 --> 00:12:46,505
do you wanna dump fuel?

192
00:12:46,619 --> 00:12:47,619
yes
dump fuel

193
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:51,502
to keep flight 671 in the air

194
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:53,563
the crew decides
to reduce it's load

195
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:58,199
this aircraft was carrying
a very heavy fuel load

196
00:12:58,582 --> 00:13:00,863
and it was imperative
to reduce that fuel load

197
00:13:01,424 --> 00:13:03,858
but it requires a
precise calculation

198
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,760
they need to leave themselves enough
fuel to reach Marseille and land safely

199
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:13,160
112 tons is the maximum
safe way in which they can land

200
00:13:14,101 --> 00:13:15,901
if there any heavier than that

201
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:19,122
and hit the ground hard, they would
sliding along the runway on their belly

202
00:13:19,284 --> 00:13:20,784
shedding fuel and burning

203
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,660
this is not a position
you wanna be in

204
00:13:23,822 --> 00:13:25,622
the process is time consuming

205
00:13:35,063 --> 00:13:38,563
as flight 671 complete its
left turn toward Marseille

206
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:42,500
captain Berglund reduces
power in the two left engines

207
00:13:43,221 --> 00:13:46,521
they had to reduce the
power on the left engines

208
00:13:46,543 --> 00:13:49,287
to give themselves a
chance of staying upright

209
00:13:49,305 --> 00:13:51,305
and going in the direction
they wanted to go in

210
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,983
reducing air speed means an
increase in the angle of descent

211
00:13:59,658 --> 00:14:03,704
unfortunately this off course meant
they then descended more rapidly

212
00:14:03,861 --> 00:14:07,603
they have to land soon and they
have to land somewhere very nearby

213
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,625
airspeed isn't the
crew's only concern

214
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,420
request the weather

215
00:14:13,981 --> 00:14:15,604
give me the weather
for Marseille, 671

216
00:14:16,818 --> 00:14:19,500
I really needed the weather
of Marseille to make a plan

217
00:14:19,621 --> 00:14:23,182
for an approach to land either direct
or a circuit or whatever we could do

218
00:14:24,624 --> 00:14:26,624
but air traffic control
isn't responding

219
00:14:28,588 --> 00:14:29,588
request weather

220
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:32,299
mayday mayday mayday
671

221
00:14:33,102 --> 00:14:34,302
request weather

222
00:14:39,302 --> 00:14:43,465
it was quite a tough call to actually
get the instant weather at that moment

223
00:14:43,825 --> 00:14:46,400
at Marseille airport
that we needed right now

224
00:14:49,462 --> 00:14:50,462
making matters worse

225
00:14:50,904 --> 00:14:52,925
the fuel dump is not
going as expected

226
00:14:55,418 --> 00:14:57,580
fuel tank number
one isn't discharging

227
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,458
that became evident
to the flight engineer

228
00:15:04,741 --> 00:15:05,741
that

229
00:15:05,862 --> 00:15:07,542
the number one fuel
tank wasn't empty

230
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:08,583
and this would cause

231
00:15:08,664 --> 00:15:12,560
a lateral imbalance across the
airplane which is not a good thing

232
00:15:12,626 --> 00:15:13,626
I've got limited maneuver

233
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:18,980
are you dumping?

234
00:15:26,146 --> 00:15:28,939
the flight engineer discovers
that a circuit breaker has popped

235
00:15:33,703 --> 00:15:35,703
while pushing the
circuit breaker back in

236
00:15:35,985 --> 00:15:38,485
he was able to reactivate
the number one fuel pomp

237
00:15:39,661 --> 00:15:43,503
and get the fuel jettisoning
from all four tank simultaneously

238
00:15:47,523 --> 00:15:50,601
flight 671 is 30 miles from
the runway in Marseille

239
00:15:52,822 --> 00:15:55,822
mayday mayday mayday
671, request weather

240
00:15:59,382 --> 00:16:00,382
it's raining

241
00:16:10,865 --> 00:16:11,865
no

242
00:16:13,661 --> 00:16:17,322
thunder clouds and the risk of turbulence
will make a difficult landing harder

243
00:16:18,743 --> 00:16:22,360
we were pushed to even get there with
the height available thunderstorm activity

244
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,780
it was really a no go

245
00:16:25,061 --> 00:16:27,562
kabo 671
what's is our distance from runway?

246
00:16:30,426 --> 00:16:31,426
22 miles, sir

247
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,020
we had no plane B

248
00:16:35,742 --> 00:16:37,762
at that point that
was a nasty moment

249
00:16:38,863 --> 00:16:41,885
what we wanted was a
runway and we wanted it quickly

250
00:16:50,103 --> 00:16:52,103
hey, do you see the airport?

251
00:16:53,787 --> 00:16:54,907
I don't see it

252
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:59,461
flight 671 is in a rapid descent
with limited maneuver ability

253
00:17:00,262 --> 00:17:02,262
less than 9 thousand
feet above southern France

254
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,582
when the crew
finally gets a break

255
00:17:07,342 --> 00:17:09,845
I looked through just
clouds, underneath us

256
00:17:09,934 --> 00:17:12,934
and I glimpsed some
ribboned black tarmac

257
00:17:13,822 --> 00:17:14,822
it was a runway

258
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:21,201
kabo 671, we have an airport
ahead, what is airport?

259
00:17:23,703 --> 00:17:25,703
it's military field, at
12 o'clock, 6 miles

260
00:17:28,785 --> 00:17:29,785
can we land that?

261
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,660
no, it's too short
too short

262
00:17:32,061 --> 00:17:34,921
how long is runway
on this military airport?

263
00:17:35,183 --> 00:17:36,183
13000 feet

264
00:17:37,705 --> 00:17:38,705
oh yeah
OK

265
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,167
the runway at Istres-Le is long

266
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,260
it's France's flight test center

267
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:47,613
and it was also a space
shuttle ultimate learning ground

268
00:17:47,664 --> 00:17:49,664
it's probably the
biggest airport in Europe

269
00:17:51,347 --> 00:17:53,347
military airport,
mayday, traffic, 671

270
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:58,243
the first officer makes contact with
air traffic control at Istres-Le airport

271
00:17:59,624 --> 00:18:01,124
671
this is Istres-Le

272
00:18:01,584 --> 00:18:04,426
you're clear to
arrival runway 33

273
00:18:06,381 --> 00:18:08,420
we're just overhead
what's the wind?

274
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:14,244
wind is a 330, 10
knots, gusty 124 knots

275
00:18:16,266 --> 00:18:18,766
we'll make a left hand
pattern from the west

276
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:19,839
yeah

277
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:23,284
the french military air traffic
control was one of my gang

278
00:18:23,624 --> 00:18:24,624
I thought he was great

279
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:26,304
we turn left to land

280
00:18:26,699 --> 00:18:27,699
yes

281
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,264
as they start their turn the
crew lowers the plane's flaps

282
00:18:31,462 --> 00:18:33,195
in preparation for landing

283
00:18:35,426 --> 00:18:37,700
wheels were down a lot, and
the flaps were coming down

284
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:40,199
so captain Berglund
would have more roll control

285
00:18:40,323 --> 00:18:42,323
but when the flaps are extended

286
00:18:42,904 --> 00:18:43,904
disaster strikes

287
00:18:49,383 --> 00:18:51,963
it was another big explosion
which try to roll us right again

288
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:57,101
turn left

289
00:18:58,223 --> 00:18:59,583
turn left to land

290
00:19:01,978 --> 00:19:03,498
turn left
I'm trying

291
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,260
turn left to land

292
00:19:11,585 --> 00:19:12,585
we missed the runway

293
00:19:14,981 --> 00:19:16,981
they're unable to
line up for landing

294
00:19:25,941 --> 00:19:27,541
671 we have fire on-board

295
00:19:27,942 --> 00:19:29,622
I confirm
fire on-board

296
00:19:31,064 --> 00:19:33,315
I could hear the fire
but didn't see anything

297
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:36,259
we need another runway

298
00:19:37,821 --> 00:19:38,821
take a runway 15

299
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:41,562
wind is a 320, 10 knots

300
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:48,839
after failing to make a hard
left for a landing on runway 33

301
00:19:49,819 --> 00:19:53,620
the crew attempts to circle back
and land on runway opposite it

302
00:19:53,955 --> 00:19:54,955
known as 15

303
00:19:56,901 --> 00:19:59,503
the captain doesn't have the
strength to make the turn on his own

304
00:20:00,304 --> 00:20:02,304
but the first
officer has an idea

305
00:20:02,825 --> 00:20:04,825
I said
I'll take the power

306
00:20:05,061 --> 00:20:07,661
and captain Berglund said to me
be careful

307
00:20:07,781 --> 00:20:09,321
I said I will
I promise

308
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:12,343
the first officer
adjusts the throttle

309
00:20:12,366 --> 00:20:14,366
to help steer the
plane to the runway

310
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:16,581
I'm bringing back number one

311
00:20:16,624 --> 00:20:17,624
advancing number 2

312
00:20:17,742 --> 00:20:21,422
it actually turn the airplane left then
he could fly it going towards the runway

313
00:20:21,484 --> 00:20:24,084
which was a miracle
truly was

314
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,800
it's a race against time

315
00:20:25,901 --> 00:20:29,741
to get the plane on the ground
before the wing is incinerated

316
00:20:34,822 --> 00:20:36,822
good descent
you're on axis

317
00:20:38,225 --> 00:20:42,181
flight 671 is flying 50 knots
faster than normal landing speed

318
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,880
captain did a perfect landing

319
00:20:51,941 --> 00:20:53,941
kept it just left
to the center line

320
00:20:54,023 --> 00:20:56,023
but we were safely on the
ground at a great speed

321
00:20:56,064 --> 00:20:57,064
but we were on the ground

322
00:20:58,345 --> 00:21:00,845
if they don't brake soon
they'll overshoot the runway

323
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:07,183
without hydraulics they have only the
plane emergency break to reduce speed

324
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:10,185
there was no anti
skid protection

325
00:21:10,246 --> 00:21:13,320
that would have meant the tires
will start scuffing and bursting

326
00:21:13,341 --> 00:21:16,183
which would then reduce
the ability to slow down

327
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,342
stopping was the only
thing that mattered

328
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:23,423
you want both trust reverses

329
00:21:23,823 --> 00:21:26,886
the flight engineer wanted to use
reverse thrust on the two left engine

330
00:21:27,506 --> 00:21:30,178
because that was the only way
he could see of slowing down

331
00:21:30,619 --> 00:21:31,619
no cut the engines

332
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,981
the first officer didn't
wanna him to do that

333
00:21:34,062 --> 00:21:36,664
because that would pull the
airplane off to the left of the runway

334
00:21:37,425 --> 00:21:38,425
I just reverse engine 2

335
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,902
as a compromise they use reverse
thrust on the inboard left engine

336
00:21:46,183 --> 00:21:47,183
the number 2 engine

337
00:21:47,623 --> 00:21:49,720
which did help reduce
their galloping speed

338
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,761
but pull the airplane
off the runway to the left

339
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,101
the aircraft did come
to a hole in the mud

340
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:07,125
we're on fire
evacuate evacuate

341
00:22:07,899 --> 00:22:09,899
I realize that we
were on the fire

342
00:22:09,921 --> 00:22:11,922
it was burning and
belching smoke and flame

343
00:22:12,182 --> 00:22:14,184
we needed to get down
get out get away

344
00:22:19,219 --> 00:22:20,219
with two missing engines

345
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,020
a wing on fire

346
00:22:22,421 --> 00:22:23,421
and no brakes

347
00:22:23,864 --> 00:22:27,164
flight 671 has landed
in Istres France

348
00:22:27,264 --> 00:22:29,264
with its cargo and crew safe

349
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,623
to actually have two of the
four engines fall off the wing

350
00:22:34,063 --> 00:22:36,065
virtually unheard of in
the history of aviation

351
00:22:37,459 --> 00:22:40,301
the heroic scape from death
makes headlines around the world

352
00:22:41,702 --> 00:22:43,702
as french investigators arrived

353
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:45,801
they faced with an
important question

354
00:22:46,302 --> 00:22:49,323
what cause two engines
to fall off a plane?

355
00:22:50,544 --> 00:22:52,544
losing two engines
is a huge thing

356
00:22:53,099 --> 00:22:56,843
so the investigators
had quite a big task

357
00:22:56,982 --> 00:23:00,183
to established what had
happened and more importantly why

358
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:02,378
and how to prevent
it happening again

359
00:23:09,302 --> 00:23:11,463
the damage 707 is
moved to a hanger

360
00:23:11,863 --> 00:23:15,782
to be examined by the BEA
France's air investigation authority

361
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:19,041
the level of damage
on this aircraft was

362
00:23:19,099 --> 00:23:22,791
very close to looking
like a total structural failure

363
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:33,583
I got something

364
00:23:33,744 --> 00:23:36,744
investigators make an early discovery
about the fire on board the plane

365
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:42,423
these wires from the
cable loom short circuited

366
00:23:42,502 --> 00:23:45,904
that plus the fuel leak from near
the engine 3 area cause the fire

367
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:47,424
good work

368
00:23:48,002 --> 00:23:51,341
when the engines
came away from the wing

369
00:23:52,742 --> 00:23:55,945
they torn with them
electrical wiring

370
00:23:56,784 --> 00:24:00,080
some of that wiring
still had power available

371
00:24:01,581 --> 00:24:03,081
when the flaps were extended

372
00:24:03,261 --> 00:24:06,704
leaking fuel made contact
with live wires and ignited

373
00:24:10,301 --> 00:24:11,301
get these cleaned up

374
00:24:11,302 --> 00:24:13,842
get a better look what tore
the engines from the wing

375
00:24:18,061 --> 00:24:21,019
investigators are counting on
the plane's flight data recorder

376
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:23,119
to provide more information

377
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,820
okay

378
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,380
see what it can tell us

379
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:41,784
it looks like engines 3 and 4 were
producing thrust right up until here

380
00:24:44,539 --> 00:24:47,039
9:50 a.m. one
hour into the flight

381
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:53,062
the FDR data reveals that both
engines stop working almost concurrently

382
00:24:54,464 --> 00:25:00,660
the flight data recorder basically
show the engines operating as normal

383
00:25:01,221 --> 00:25:02,721
when they left the aircraft

384
00:25:07,945 --> 00:25:12,920
to understand why two perfectly
functioning engines detached from 707 wings

385
00:25:13,862 --> 00:25:15,863
investigators need to
find the missing engines

386
00:25:16,703 --> 00:25:17,703
here is the flight path

387
00:25:23,143 --> 00:25:25,143
this is where they
probably fell off

388
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:32,364
I'll send a search and
recovery team out there

389
00:25:37,982 --> 00:25:39,982
24 hours into the investigation

390
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:45,640
the engines of 671 are located on a
mountain side near Séderon France

391
00:25:46,301 --> 00:25:49,384
55 miles north east of
where the plane landed

392
00:25:51,901 --> 00:25:55,963
investigators found the
engines about 800 meters apart

393
00:25:58,024 --> 00:25:59,524
that's very close

394
00:25:59,707 --> 00:26:02,900
their location also suggest the engines
detached at almost the same time

395
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:08,579
while the team waits for
the engines to be recovered

396
00:26:08,658 --> 00:26:10,658
they turn to the crew
for further insight

397
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:16,105
we were climbing to 43000 feet to
avoid some pretty bad turbulence

398
00:26:17,866 --> 00:26:19,866
suddenly there were loud sounds

399
00:26:28,465 --> 00:26:30,465
I saw engine 4 was missing

400
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:36,202
you reported the engine's
missing at 2 different times

401
00:26:37,059 --> 00:26:39,059
is it possibly you
were mistaking?

402
00:26:39,341 --> 00:26:40,341
it's possible

403
00:26:40,782 --> 00:26:44,479
the harness size wearing kept me from
getting a good look out the window at first

404
00:26:44,901 --> 00:26:46,501
you're climbing
to avoid turbulence

405
00:26:46,581 --> 00:26:47,581
how bad was it?

406
00:26:47,902 --> 00:26:48,942
it was severe

407
00:26:48,979 --> 00:26:50,579
I wouldn't want to
get for that again

408
00:26:52,041 --> 00:26:55,122
they'd flown through
extremely heavy turbulence

409
00:26:55,515 --> 00:26:57,615
of a level not
normally encountered

410
00:27:01,062 --> 00:27:04,179
so they were two cumulonimbus
clouds here and here

411
00:27:06,098 --> 00:27:08,098
and they went up
passed 33000 feet

412
00:27:10,578 --> 00:27:13,662
investigators examine the weather
conditions of the time of the incident

413
00:27:15,062 --> 00:27:17,659
looks like there was also a
90 knots jet stream over here

414
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:29,539
they discover that flight 671
flew through 2 weather conditions

415
00:27:29,658 --> 00:27:31,658
when they reached 33000 feet

416
00:27:33,821 --> 00:27:36,822
those two conditions would
have generated sever turbulence

417
00:27:36,824 --> 00:27:39,344
but he would think it could
withstand the turbulence

418
00:27:39,939 --> 00:27:44,140
did two colliding weather conditions
tear the engines off the 707?

419
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,980
let's see what the
engines can tell us

420
00:27:58,275 --> 00:27:59,275
hey boss

421
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:05,063
close examination of the engines
gives investigators an important new clue

422
00:28:08,147 --> 00:28:10,147
do you see these
dents on engine 4?

423
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:13,623
it's shape and diameter
match dents on engine 3

424
00:28:13,902 --> 00:28:14,902
so does these white paint

425
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,860
you could tell from the
shape of the damage

426
00:28:19,901 --> 00:28:23,401
and from transfer
white paint from

427
00:28:23,818 --> 00:28:25,718
one engine to the other engine

428
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:29,263
that the number 3 had
struck the number 4 engine

429
00:28:30,343 --> 00:28:31,343
and separated it

430
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:36,680
investigators now need to find
out what cause engine 3 to detached

431
00:28:42,185 --> 00:28:44,238
looks like a clean
break of all 4 fittings

432
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,100
each engine is
attached to a pylon

433
00:28:48,942 --> 00:28:52,540
the pylon is then bolted to
the wing using 4 large fittings

434
00:28:53,461 --> 00:28:57,703
during flight 671 all 4
fittings broke on engine 3

435
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,680
3 of the 4 fittings
broke like this one

436
00:29:04,702 --> 00:29:07,982
you can see from the
surface they broke from stress

437
00:29:10,346 --> 00:29:12,346
this midspar
fitting is different

438
00:29:14,262 --> 00:29:16,262
there is some distortion here

439
00:29:16,502 --> 00:29:18,583
likely broke from
a fatigue fraction

440
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:23,580
you could see
some characteristics

441
00:29:23,662 --> 00:29:25,662
surface wise
coloration wise

442
00:29:26,744 --> 00:29:29,244
that were consistent
with a fatigue cracking

443
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,061
over time

444
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,800
the inboard midspar fitting
on engine 3 was weakened

445
00:29:36,901 --> 00:29:39,634
because of a crack
cause by metal fatigue

446
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:43,380
when it snapped off
in sever turbulence

447
00:29:43,421 --> 00:29:45,421
the other fittings broke too

448
00:29:46,264 --> 00:29:49,339
as a metallurgist I want to
take a close look at these things

449
00:29:58,626 --> 00:30:00,726
okay let's see what we got

450
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:06,821
to establish a detailed history of
flight 671's broken midspar fitting

451
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:10,143
investigators use an electron
microscope to examine it

452
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:13,064
I can see multiple arrest lines

453
00:30:14,026 --> 00:30:17,061
with each take off and landing
the crack grows a little bit

454
00:30:18,554 --> 00:30:19,554
at least a mark

455
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,820
and

456
00:30:22,221 --> 00:30:25,263
each little stress cycle
makes the crack a little bigger

457
00:30:26,744 --> 00:30:30,281
these are likely from the flight plane
flew since trans air put it back in service

458
00:30:30,682 --> 00:30:31,682
a few weeks ago

459
00:30:32,423 --> 00:30:33,423
what about before that?

460
00:30:34,979 --> 00:30:37,981
as the team continues
examining the crack midspar fitting

461
00:30:38,618 --> 00:30:40,618
they make an unusual finding

462
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,460
looks like corrosion

463
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:48,000
the plane had to have been exposed
to moisture over a long period of time

464
00:30:48,542 --> 00:30:49,542
right

465
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:56,983
looks like the previous owner
had the plane in storage for

466
00:30:57,618 --> 00:30:59,618
13 month prior to incident

467
00:30:59,901 --> 00:31:00,901
where was it stored?

468
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:06,820
in a field in England

469
00:31:09,783 --> 00:31:14,283
steel will corrode if
it's in a salty atmosphere

470
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,580
or very moist atmosphere

471
00:31:16,859 --> 00:31:21,983
this particular aircraft was stored at
airfields which weren't far from the sea

472
00:31:23,023 --> 00:31:24,023
that explains corrosion

473
00:31:29,021 --> 00:31:31,321
what are those?
those little marks

474
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:34,141
near the bottom of the fitting

475
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,980
they discover
several tail tail marks

476
00:31:37,622 --> 00:31:40,022
those are corrosion pit marks

477
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:46,760
corrosion pits are tiny holes
that appear in metal after water

478
00:31:46,899 --> 00:31:51,899
has gain access to that metal and
caused corrosion to takes place

479
00:31:52,103 --> 00:31:55,160
and the pit can be
the start of a long crack

480
00:31:55,501 --> 00:31:57,562
and in this case there
were corrosion pits

481
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:02,762
that grow into the one crack and
eventually fracture the midspar fitting

482
00:32:03,944 --> 00:32:05,944
so when these
pit marks start to develop?

483
00:32:06,122 --> 00:32:07,802
it's hard to pinpoint exactly

484
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:11,301
given their distance from
the arrest lines it's suggest that

485
00:32:11,363 --> 00:32:13,959
the pitting started even before
the plane went into storage

486
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:17,737
the crack doesn't
occur in storage

487
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,140
oxidation does

488
00:32:19,582 --> 00:32:23,823
so that tells us the cracking
occurred before storage

489
00:32:25,464 --> 00:32:28,564
probably years before storage

490
00:32:34,422 --> 00:32:36,463
so how did maintenance
team miss it?

491
00:32:39,225 --> 00:32:41,325
this just arrived from trans air

492
00:32:41,346 --> 00:32:42,786
maintenance records

493
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,380
let's have a look

494
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:48,240
investigators want to know if
poor maintenance on flight 671

495
00:32:48,703 --> 00:32:50,383
contributed to the crash

496
00:32:51,818 --> 00:32:55,621
you start look at the
age of the parts that failed

497
00:32:55,781 --> 00:32:58,782
and what was the maintenance
requirements for those parts

498
00:32:59,504 --> 00:33:03,304
and did they play a
role in the accident?

499
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:08,342
in the 1919 Nigeria
airlines like trans air

500
00:33:08,823 --> 00:33:12,523
gain the reputation
for poor maintenance

501
00:33:13,339 --> 00:33:14,339
for a while

502
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:18,023
Nigeria airways were in facts
banned from united kingdom space

503
00:33:20,419 --> 00:33:23,561
according this Trans air didn't
do a midspar maintenance check

504
00:33:25,783 --> 00:33:29,758
Trans air had only owned that
airplane for a very small amount of times

505
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:33,061
so it's unlikely that they
performed any maintenance on it so

506
00:33:33,982 --> 00:33:38,180
maybe Trans air inherited the
problem before it was owned by them

507
00:33:41,041 --> 00:33:44,044
looks like the previous owner
did two maintenance checks

508
00:33:44,138 --> 00:33:47,460
one Oct 10th 1991
when the plane was in storage

509
00:33:48,942 --> 00:33:52,027
the other May 1990
before it went to storage

510
00:33:53,179 --> 00:33:56,479
the team learns that the plane
pasted two maintenance checks

511
00:33:56,662 --> 00:33:59,240
in a two year period
prior to the incident

512
00:34:00,782 --> 00:34:03,282
if the metal fatigue
started before the storage

513
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:05,659
maintenance check should
have caught the problem

514
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:10,742
there were certain cracks that should
have been picked up which weren't

515
00:34:12,221 --> 00:34:14,521
then one month
into the investigation

516
00:34:15,063 --> 00:34:17,063
another 707 loses engine

517
00:34:18,384 --> 00:34:21,527
the incident is similar to
what happened to flight 671

518
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:25,400
during take off from
Miami international airport

519
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:29,940
the number 3 engine is torn off
the wing and then hits engine 4

520
00:34:31,662 --> 00:34:35,962
with the Miami accident, the pilots
managed to land the aircraft safely

521
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,820
with no one being hurt

522
00:34:39,543 --> 00:34:44,143
the NTSB investigates and
discovers that a broken midspar fitting

523
00:34:44,265 --> 00:34:47,065
also cause the engine
to fall off the wing

524
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:50,460
this was perhaps
history repeating itself

525
00:34:54,142 --> 00:34:55,142
is that from the NTSB?

526
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,384
yep

527
00:34:57,464 --> 00:35:01,006
french investigators review
the NTSB preliminary report

528
00:35:01,147 --> 00:35:04,039
curios about the Miami’s
plane's maintenance history

529
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:09,100
the maintenance on the 707 Miami was
performed 328 flights before the accident

530
00:35:09,825 --> 00:35:12,880
which is well within the 600
flight recommendation by the FAA

531
00:35:14,344 --> 00:35:18,144
they discover that the plane had
also passed maintenance checks

532
00:35:18,261 --> 00:35:20,860
and reported no fatigue
cracking or corrosion

533
00:35:22,782 --> 00:35:26,738
in both the Miami accident
and the French accident

534
00:35:27,979 --> 00:35:31,942
the midspar fitting had
failed with a very similar way

535
00:35:32,783 --> 00:35:39,542
and had also been maintained specified
by the FAA and Boeing aircraft company

536
00:35:40,943 --> 00:35:42,985
perhaps they weren't
maintaining properly

537
00:35:44,867 --> 00:35:49,942
at a time the midspar fitting
were required to be inspected

538
00:35:50,783 --> 00:35:52,883
in close visual examination

539
00:35:53,874 --> 00:35:54,874
basically

540
00:35:55,659 --> 00:35:57,339
you gain access to the fitting

541
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:01,143
you wipe it off the best you can

542
00:36:01,625 --> 00:36:05,147
and what you can see
is what you examine

543
00:36:06,978 --> 00:36:09,501
was there a problem with
the inspection process?

544
00:36:10,341 --> 00:36:12,841
investigators interview
a maintenance supervisor

545
00:36:12,899 --> 00:36:15,971
about how engine fittings
are approved for flight

546
00:36:17,703 --> 00:36:19,724
so how do you
inspect the fitting?

547
00:36:19,985 --> 00:36:22,185
you supposed to carry
out close visual inspection

548
00:36:22,266 --> 00:36:25,274
for cracks on the expose
surfaces of the fitting

549
00:36:25,861 --> 00:36:26,861
and

550
00:36:27,261 --> 00:36:28,261
well

551
00:36:28,363 --> 00:36:30,322
cracks can start on
the inside of the fitting

552
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:31,359
so why is that a problem?

553
00:36:31,419 --> 00:36:32,419
well it's problem

554
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,680
cause you can't see inside

555
00:36:33,681 --> 00:36:36,865
unless you remove the engine
and the pylon from the wing

556
00:36:37,579 --> 00:36:38,579
it's troubling discovery

557
00:36:40,421 --> 00:36:45,061
the midspar fitting is normally inspected
by removing a panel on the pylon

558
00:36:45,502 --> 00:36:49,119
but the entire fitting cannot
be seen from access panel

559
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,840
the engine and pylon
need to be removed

560
00:36:51,981 --> 00:36:54,481
to check the cracks on
the inside of the fitting

561
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:02,980
Boeing did not require this
assembly of the midspar fitting

562
00:37:04,381 --> 00:37:07,981
the risk assessment
basically said it's not worth it

563
00:37:08,063 --> 00:37:09,063
on this old air frame

564
00:37:10,898 --> 00:37:14,420
so there could be 707 out there with
cracks on its fitting that no one can see

565
00:37:14,541 --> 00:37:15,541
yeah

566
00:37:18,063 --> 00:37:20,763
as an investigator you
always have to wonder

567
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:23,996
how many more engines
are going to fall off of 707s

568
00:37:32,942 --> 00:37:33,942
listen to this

569
00:37:34,384 --> 00:37:36,684
investigators of flight 671

570
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:40,742
do a deep dive into the history
of the Boeing 707 midspar fitting

571
00:37:42,425 --> 00:37:46,420
there have been reports more than
35 cracks midspar fitting on the 707

572
00:37:46,861 --> 00:37:48,941
these planes are the
end of their life cycle

573
00:37:49,702 --> 00:37:52,220
707 in Miami had flown
over a 50,000 hours

574
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,878
Trans air 707 had flown
over a 60,000 hours

575
00:37:57,261 --> 00:38:01,782
these was an old fitting on an old airplane
that'd been designed a very long time ago

576
00:38:03,059 --> 00:38:05,841
and when they didn't know
how these materials would age

577
00:38:06,182 --> 00:38:09,858
the consequence of these and perhaps
not the best maintenance or inspection

578
00:38:09,858 --> 00:38:12,261
and that eventually
this fitting just gave up

579
00:38:13,781 --> 00:38:14,781
by 1992

580
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:18,905
most 707 were considered
too old to fly passengers

581
00:38:19,465 --> 00:38:21,440
and were converted
to freight transport

582
00:38:24,541 --> 00:38:26,542
we need to make sure
this doesn't happen again

583
00:38:28,144 --> 00:38:32,244
investigators conclude that a
hidden fracture in the midspar fitting

584
00:38:32,379 --> 00:38:36,102
almost took the life of the 5
man on Trans air flight 671

585
00:38:43,301 --> 00:38:44,901
the fate of the plane is sealed

586
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:48,990
when a maintenance inspection
fails to catch the fatigue crack

587
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,380
ask if we can go to 33

588
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:57,423
the 707 is pushed
to its breaking point

589
00:38:57,425 --> 00:38:59,225
when two weather events collide

590
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:05,340
the in-flight
turbulence was the last

591
00:39:06,139 --> 00:39:09,083
little bit that was
necessary to cause fracture

592
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:15,300
basically was the last straw
that held this pylon together

593
00:39:16,141 --> 00:39:20,864
the weaken midspar fitting finally
breaks and both engines are lost

594
00:39:25,982 --> 00:39:27,923
if not for the
heroics of the crew

595
00:39:27,983 --> 00:39:29,683
the plane would have crashed

596
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:35,263
the 707 is not an easy airplane
to fly when everything is going well

597
00:39:35,702 --> 00:39:38,666
it's a very difficult airplane to
fly when things are going wrong

598
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:41,168
I've got limited maneuver

599
00:39:42,459 --> 00:39:43,459
you dumping

600
00:39:44,741 --> 00:39:45,741
yeah

601
00:39:46,302 --> 00:39:49,144
captain Berglund skill and
stamina prove remarkable

602
00:39:49,704 --> 00:39:52,560
as he physically keeps
the plane stable until landing

603
00:39:54,702 --> 00:39:58,184
from the beginning of the incident to
when they finally landed on the runway

604
00:39:58,384 --> 00:39:59,384
24 minutes

605
00:39:59,826 --> 00:40:02,566
a 24 minutes that most pilots

606
00:40:02,618 --> 00:40:06,022
wouldn't have had all those
things happen in their entire career

607
00:40:06,141 --> 00:40:08,541
he was just one fantastic pilots

608
00:40:12,901 --> 00:40:14,901
kabo 671 
we have no radar contact

609
00:40:15,462 --> 00:40:17,162
say your position please sir

610
00:40:17,738 --> 00:40:19,538
throughout the harrowing flight

611
00:40:19,981 --> 00:40:22,982
flight engineer Boone
troubleshoots and fixes key systems

612
00:40:25,063 --> 00:40:29,020
flight engineer look to this panel
and came up with the solution

613
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,200
as to why the
radar wasn't working

614
00:40:32,142 --> 00:40:33,142
you turn left 180

615
00:40:34,984 --> 00:40:35,984
okay

616
00:40:41,342 --> 00:40:42,342
hey

617
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:43,523
do you see the airport?

618
00:40:43,663 --> 00:40:47,066
and first officer Emery's quick
thinking and intuition proved vital

619
00:40:48,171 --> 00:40:49,771
kabo 671
we have an airport ahead

620
00:40:49,859 --> 00:40:51,859
what is that airport?

621
00:40:52,142 --> 00:40:55,818
it was an absolute genius decision to
land at a military base with a long runway

622
00:41:01,422 --> 00:41:03,222
it shows an awful lot about

623
00:41:03,385 --> 00:41:06,385
that spirit of pilots and survival
that they somehow coalesce together

624
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:10,982
they all use their
own individual skills

625
00:41:15,865 --> 00:41:20,339
the BEA recommends that inspection
of the current midspar fitting be modified

626
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,900
to enable the detection
of hidden cracks

627
00:41:23,182 --> 00:41:25,419
all be replaced by
reinforced fittings

628
00:41:29,341 --> 00:41:34,341
the FAA decided to mandate
replacement of the midspar fittings

629
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:37,560
with a new and
improved midspar fittings

630
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:41,362
which did not
require inspections

631
00:41:41,505 --> 00:41:44,920
that were ineffective
on the first place

632
00:41:46,021 --> 00:41:49,621
in 1992 the crew of
Trans air cargo 671

633
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:53,299
recieved the Hugh Gordon-Burge
Award for outstanding airmanship

634
00:41:54,942 --> 00:41:56,742
this flight was a
heroic acheivement

635
00:41:56,784 --> 00:42:01,980
where the crew have recovered
from a virtually impossibe situation

636
00:42:02,141 --> 00:42:04,360
and they deserve
the awards they've got

637
00:42:04,701 --> 00:42:07,701
so a lot of luck and
a bit of team work

638
00:42:07,783 --> 00:42:10,383
and a bit of shouting
and a bit of action

639
00:42:10,619 --> 00:42:11,619
but happy landing
