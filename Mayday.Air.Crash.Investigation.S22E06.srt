1
00:00:01,943 --> 00:00:02,943
pull over

2
00:00:03,385 --> 00:00:07,160
a Boeing 727 spirals out
of control over Michigan

3
00:00:07,581 --> 00:00:11,064
you're watching the world
spinning outside the window

4
00:00:11,163 --> 00:00:13,163
this would be sheer start terror

5
00:00:13,866 --> 00:00:15,366
speed 20
350

6
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:17,683
come on
come on

7
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:19,219
no no no

8
00:00:19,661 --> 00:00:21,741
investigators track
down pieces of debris

9
00:00:23,864 --> 00:00:24,864
slat number 7

10
00:00:28,942 --> 00:00:29,942
broken in 2

11
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:33,164
and interview fellow pilots

12
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,900
off the record
off the record

13
00:00:35,741 --> 00:00:37,823
they even risked their own lives

14
00:00:38,863 --> 00:00:40,463
okay, test number 9

15
00:00:40,865 --> 00:00:45,661
to find out what caused TWA
flight 841's uncontrollable plunge

16
00:00:47,062 --> 00:00:48,422
do you feel that?

17
00:01:15,664 --> 00:01:16,664
it was insane

18
00:01:17,664 --> 00:01:19,864
my hands are still shaking

19
00:01:20,506 --> 00:01:23,306
44 year old captain
Harvey "Hoot" Gibson

20
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,122
has just returned from the
most harrowing flight of his life

21
00:01:27,263 --> 00:01:28,943
tell me what happened

22
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:35,022
a representative from the federal
aviation administration takes his statement

23
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:39,379
we cruise over Michigan

24
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:50,291
that sure is a strong headwind

25
00:01:52,262 --> 00:01:54,862
captain Gibson is a
trained stunt pilot

26
00:01:54,923 --> 00:01:58,323
who has a clean 16 year record
with Trans World Airlines

27
00:02:04,465 --> 00:02:05,465
sure thing
hoot

28
00:02:06,186 --> 00:02:10,901
first officer Scott Kennedy has
been flying with TWA for 13 years

29
00:02:14,063 --> 00:02:15,604
we're good to go
any time you want to

30
00:02:15,785 --> 00:02:18,285
flight engineer Gary
Banks is an air force veteran

31
00:02:18,467 --> 00:02:21,059
who is being with TWA
for the last 10 years

32
00:02:21,861 --> 00:02:26,338
the crew of flight 841 had just the right
kind of experience you would want for a

33
00:02:26,338 --> 00:02:27,338
727 crew

34
00:02:29,702 --> 00:02:30,702
center
TWA 841

35
00:02:31,143 --> 00:02:33,183
we'd like to try
flight level 390

36
00:02:34,218 --> 00:02:38,861
roger TWA 841
climb and maintain flight level 390

37
00:02:44,059 --> 00:02:47,459
they were blocking a 100
knots of wind on their nose

38
00:02:47,742 --> 00:02:50,024
so he was looking for
better winds up higher

39
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:52,704
the higher you go

40
00:02:53,426 --> 00:02:55,920
you essentially go faster
through the thinner air

41
00:02:55,981 --> 00:02:58,163
and that will hopefully get
you a better ground speed

42
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:12,259
I take that off your hands

43
00:03:12,262 --> 00:03:15,302
27 year old mark moscicki
is today's lead flight attendant

44
00:03:17,904 --> 00:03:21,980
he and 3 other attendants look
after the 82 passengers on board

45
00:03:25,744 --> 00:03:26,744
it was an evening flight

46
00:03:27,138 --> 00:03:28,138
was leaving JFK

47
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,701
it was the first time I've
flown with this cockpit crew

48
00:03:33,064 --> 00:03:35,139
everything was absolutely smooth

49
00:03:35,621 --> 00:03:39,222
they're flying the narrow
body Boeing 727 aircraft

50
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:43,360
the 727 was massively overbuilt

51
00:03:44,022 --> 00:03:45,522
it was very sturdy airplane

52
00:03:45,564 --> 00:03:48,064
it's like driving sport
car or fighter plane

53
00:03:48,138 --> 00:03:50,138
it was very light
on the controls

54
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,619
it had that feeling that you could
just put it where ever you want

55
00:03:55,462 --> 00:03:57,362
after a 45 minute
delay in New York

56
00:03:57,743 --> 00:04:01,185
the flight to Minneapolis
will take about 3.5 hours

57
00:04:06,981 --> 00:04:08,781
they programmed 39,000 feet

58
00:04:09,543 --> 00:04:11,543
they've got right up there

59
00:04:11,567 --> 00:04:13,799
and sure enough they
were gaining speed

60
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,961
they were probably gonna cut 10
to 15 minutes off there in route time

61
00:04:19,503 --> 00:04:21,803
I'll do another
ground speed check

62
00:04:32,428 --> 00:04:35,943
our settings adjusted
everything looks good

63
00:04:36,382 --> 00:04:40,425
after meal service, moscicki
takes a moment to eat his own meal

64
00:04:40,824 --> 00:04:41,824
I sat in my jump seat

65
00:04:44,227 --> 00:04:49,301
very shortly however
there was very rupt buffering

66
00:04:49,861 --> 00:04:50,861
of the aircraft

67
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:52,542
it wasn't turbulence

68
00:04:54,664 --> 00:04:55,784
what the heck?

69
00:04:55,825 --> 00:04:57,940
the captain notice
something was strange

70
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:01,702
the wing had started to drop and the
auto pilot was compensating for that

71
00:05:04,584 --> 00:05:05,864
I've got control

72
00:05:06,018 --> 00:05:08,681
disengaging the auto pilot was
the right thing to do at that time

73
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:12,220
that's the first thing you think of
something is wrong with the auto pilot

74
00:05:12,303 --> 00:05:13,303
what's going on?

75
00:05:15,145 --> 00:05:18,539
without any warning, the
plane banks hard to the right

76
00:05:20,221 --> 00:05:21,221
airspeed 240

77
00:05:24,745 --> 00:05:25,745
come on

78
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:29,241
but if the plane
still doesn't respond

79
00:05:29,321 --> 00:05:31,421
then you think the
same about your plane

80
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,020
the plane just
kept rolling right

81
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:37,063
and started rattling
really hard too

82
00:05:38,661 --> 00:05:40,661
I would be trying the rudder

83
00:05:41,061 --> 00:05:43,061
and if that's not doing the job

84
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,300
I start trying to
flight with the engines

85
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:48,741
but 727, the engines are all
clustered together in the back

86
00:05:48,938 --> 00:05:51,039
that probably wouldn't
help you that much

87
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:53,401
so this would be
sheer stark terror

88
00:05:53,402 --> 00:05:54,402
shutting the throttles

89
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:58,346
the captain tries to slow
the plane to regain control

90
00:05:59,346 --> 00:06:01,346
but the aircraft
isn't responding

91
00:06:11,985 --> 00:06:12,985
get them up
get them up

92
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:17,300
desperate to slow the plane,
Gibson deploys the speed brakes

93
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:25,047
speed brakes are flight control surfaces
that increase drag and improve roll control

94
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:30,141
you're gonna put those
out to try slow yourself down

95
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:35,667
because really bad things are gonna start
happening soon if you keep accelerating

96
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:37,469
come on
come on

97
00:06:39,028 --> 00:06:41,559
but deploying the speed
brakes proved useless

98
00:06:44,341 --> 00:06:45,805
I've got up from my jump seat

99
00:06:45,842 --> 00:06:47,486
to see if perhaps
the engine was on fire

100
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,325
and I never made it

101
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,520
high above Saginaw Michigan

102
00:07:04,581 --> 00:07:08,124
the Boeing 727 drops
into an uncontrolled dive

103
00:07:08,225 --> 00:07:10,225
and spins upside down

104
00:07:11,299 --> 00:07:13,299
something was extremely wrong

105
00:07:13,581 --> 00:07:15,581
there seem to be no
control over airplane

106
00:07:15,658 --> 00:07:18,158
people were just
absolutely terrified

107
00:07:20,462 --> 00:07:23,605
I sincerely didn't think that we
had wings left on the airplane

108
00:07:30,582 --> 00:07:32,182
TWA 841
it's center

109
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:37,088
TWA 841
center

110
00:07:42,143 --> 00:07:43,143
Jesus

111
00:07:44,986 --> 00:07:46,686
something is seriously wrong

112
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,521
you would have your
hands full of airplane

113
00:07:51,782 --> 00:07:54,814
you're watching the world
spinning outside the window

114
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:58,141
you're being pressed by g-forces
it also must have been insanely noisy

115
00:07:58,782 --> 00:08:01,443
it would be very difficult
trying troubleshoot the problem

116
00:08:01,703 --> 00:08:03,303
TWA 841
do you read me?

117
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:10,203
the controllers watch helplessly as
TWA 841 plummets towards the ground

118
00:08:11,539 --> 00:08:13,940
once the nose comes
down on an airliner

119
00:08:14,621 --> 00:08:17,702
they want to pick up speed and
hurry if he pointed at the ground

120
00:08:19,544 --> 00:08:22,144
I kept clenching my
jaws and biting my teeth

121
00:08:22,378 --> 00:08:24,358
to keep blood in my head

122
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:26,399
the g-forces were so extreme

123
00:08:26,941 --> 00:08:29,382
I thought that I was
going passed out

124
00:08:29,784 --> 00:08:32,845
the blood is literally being
drained out of your head

125
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:34,981
and you will first

126
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,621
lose your vision,
that's called graying out

127
00:08:38,064 --> 00:08:40,264
and then the next
thing is you black out

128
00:08:40,295 --> 00:08:42,295
which is where you
lose consciousness

129
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,200
because your heart just
can't pump the blood

130
00:08:44,302 --> 00:08:46,922
up to your brain against
all that force of gravity

131
00:08:49,346 --> 00:08:50,546
the speed is 220

132
00:08:51,306 --> 00:08:52,306
350

133
00:08:57,223 --> 00:08:59,123
I can't
I can't

134
00:09:01,745 --> 00:09:07,280
TWA 841 spiraling towards the
earth at the rate of 540 feet per second

135
00:09:08,461 --> 00:09:09,761
to feel 6 g

136
00:09:09,862 --> 00:09:12,542
the only people that would
experience that would be military pilots

137
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:15,580
you're gonna feel an incredible
weight on every part of you

138
00:09:15,761 --> 00:09:17,761
and whatever
position your body is in

139
00:09:17,784 --> 00:09:19,144
your head
your arms

140
00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:20,749
they're gonna stay that way

141
00:09:20,802 --> 00:09:22,802
so you're not gonna
be able to move

142
00:09:25,863 --> 00:09:27,263
I could see ground lights

143
00:09:27,264 --> 00:09:30,305
and I knew that we were
approaching the ground very quickly

144
00:09:31,226 --> 00:09:33,326
that point you go
from abject terror

145
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,060
into almost acceptance

146
00:09:36,341 --> 00:09:37,341
no no no

147
00:09:38,623 --> 00:09:40,623
come on baby
pull up

148
00:09:49,023 --> 00:09:50,723
we were falling so fast

149
00:09:51,025 --> 00:09:53,725
captain Hoot Gibson
recounts his recent nightmare

150
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:56,926
piloting TWA flight
841 over Michigan

151
00:09:58,900 --> 00:09:59,900
air speed is 390

152
00:10:01,462 --> 00:10:03,262
but Gibson isn't giving up

153
00:10:03,463 --> 00:10:05,063
come on baby
pull up

154
00:10:05,184 --> 00:10:06,684
he has an idea

155
00:10:07,187 --> 00:10:08,847
put the gear down

156
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,220
if nothing else
will slow you down

157
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,340
the gear will slow you down

158
00:10:16,362 --> 00:10:18,403
and hopefully the
plane's hold together

159
00:10:30,665 --> 00:10:31,665
that's it

160
00:10:31,706 --> 00:10:33,126
that's it baby

161
00:10:39,861 --> 00:10:41,662
what's saved them was
putting the gear down

162
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:44,542
because otherwise they would
have been big smoking crater

163
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:45,544
a matter of seconds

164
00:10:49,378 --> 00:10:50,878
we're pitching up
30 degrees

165
00:10:55,024 --> 00:10:56,924
you know suddenly
we were climbing

166
00:10:56,944 --> 00:10:59,627
it was like coming out of
the bottom of a roller coaster

167
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:02,680
you would feel like
you are being crushed

168
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,680
the average person

169
00:11:04,863 --> 00:11:08,184
would feel like they
weight 900 pounds

170
00:11:08,265 --> 00:11:09,765
Scott give me the altitude

171
00:11:10,026 --> 00:11:11,526
Gary, pitch and airspeed

172
00:11:12,308 --> 00:11:14,308
5200 feet, Jesus
which way is up?

173
00:11:20,183 --> 00:11:21,183
moon

174
00:11:22,859 --> 00:11:24,859
it's pitch-black and you've

175
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,922
just been spiraling
down towards the earth

176
00:11:28,263 --> 00:11:30,363
and you're probably disoriented

177
00:11:30,825 --> 00:11:32,825
he sees the moon and that's up

178
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:36,740
you can sort the rest out later
but get away from the ground

179
00:11:38,384 --> 00:11:42,424
TWA 841 has come
within seconds of impact

180
00:11:42,859 --> 00:11:45,420
and now climbs back
towards the night sky

181
00:11:47,944 --> 00:11:49,444
airspeed is 160

182
00:11:51,346 --> 00:11:54,247
though the pilots are flying
again they're not out of danger

183
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,181
the steep climb is
physically demanding

184
00:11:58,621 --> 00:12:00,802
and the crew struggles
to maintain focus

185
00:12:04,546 --> 00:12:05,546
10,500

186
00:12:06,667 --> 00:12:07,667
11,000

187
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,780
that's it
that's it hoot

188
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,060
leveling 110

189
00:12:17,425 --> 00:12:19,425
this is your captain speaking

190
00:12:19,426 --> 00:12:20,786
as you've noticed

191
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,740
we've had a little
bit of problem

192
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,801
but everything seems
to be under control

193
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:33,541
we lost system A hydraulics

194
00:12:33,903 --> 00:12:35,403
fluid is down
pressure is down

195
00:12:36,745 --> 00:12:39,667
as the crew recovers
from the terrifying incident

196
00:12:40,108 --> 00:12:41,808
they assess
damage to the aircraft

197
00:12:47,104 --> 00:12:50,645
a deafening rattle makes
the tense situation worse

198
00:12:51,619 --> 00:12:52,619
okay

199
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:54,432
I'm gonna fly the airplane

200
00:12:54,461 --> 00:12:56,461
you guys for running
the emergencies

201
00:12:57,303 --> 00:12:59,303
he had them diagnose the problem

202
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,413
while he flew the airplane

203
00:13:02,661 --> 00:13:04,661
knowing that you
can't do both effectively

204
00:13:05,224 --> 00:13:08,304
turn (pop) emergency switches
to depressurize and check quantity

205
00:13:08,906 --> 00:13:10,906
the fluid is zero
it’s all gone

206
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:16,362
with the damage to hydraulic
system the aircraft is severely impaired

207
00:13:17,904 --> 00:13:19,304
I think we gotta land

208
00:13:19,304 --> 00:13:21,104
Detroit is our best option

209
00:13:21,145 --> 00:13:22,145
okay

210
00:13:25,061 --> 00:13:26,061
we're 60 miles out

211
00:13:27,622 --> 00:13:30,422
when they decided to divert
they selected Detroit

212
00:13:30,465 --> 00:13:32,265
with reasonable weather
long runways

213
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,422
it's a developed airport
with crash fire rescue

214
00:13:35,861 --> 00:13:36,861
center
841

215
00:13:37,143 --> 00:13:38,143
go ahead
TWA 841

216
00:13:39,704 --> 00:13:40,704
okay listen

217
00:13:41,146 --> 00:13:43,546
we had a problem
we lost about 20,000 feet

218
00:13:44,538 --> 00:13:46,038
we need vectors to Detroit

219
00:13:46,501 --> 00:13:48,001
45 miles for Detroit now

220
00:13:48,502 --> 00:13:50,602
if you like to come left

221
00:13:50,743 --> 00:13:53,043
heading 160
vectors to Detroit

222
00:13:53,586 --> 00:13:54,586
okay

223
00:13:55,147 --> 00:13:56,187
turn left 160

224
00:13:56,308 --> 00:13:57,308
TWA 841

225
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:06,758
remove your glasses, earrings
and anything else that might be sharp

226
00:14:09,341 --> 00:14:11,922
place anything soft in your
lap to cushion the impact

227
00:14:14,425 --> 00:14:16,025
30 miles from the airport

228
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:19,099
flight attendance prepare the
cabin for an emergency landing

229
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:22,802
passengers were amazingly
quite I mean they looked at us

230
00:14:22,822 --> 00:14:24,502
for a complete direction

231
00:14:24,503 --> 00:14:26,003
15 miles to Detroit now

232
00:14:26,905 --> 00:14:28,905
nice and easy
I mean flaps 15

233
00:14:29,747 --> 00:14:31,747
unaware of the
extent of the damage

234
00:14:32,019 --> 00:14:34,619
Gibson tests the
aircraft's control ability

235
00:14:35,102 --> 00:14:36,102
flaps 15

236
00:14:37,804 --> 00:14:38,804
woo woo woo

237
00:14:39,224 --> 00:14:40,584
retract the flaps

238
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:44,840
extending the flaps causes
the plane to roll sharply to the left

239
00:14:45,741 --> 00:14:48,541
you're going to land
without flaps at this point

240
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:51,480
which means you're
going to go very fast

241
00:14:52,221 --> 00:14:55,022
much faster than you
would ever land this airplane

242
00:14:55,303 --> 00:14:57,303
only fast
there is no other way

243
00:15:12,985 --> 00:15:14,585
this is our only approach

244
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:17,720
with ruptured hydraulic
and a compromised plane

245
00:15:18,021 --> 00:15:23,124
the pilots of TWA 841 have only
one shot landing at Detroit airport

246
00:15:27,587 --> 00:15:29,587
landing check is complete

247
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:30,759
coming through 200 feet

248
00:15:35,262 --> 00:15:39,466
I was pretty convinced that we'd
probably scrapping down the runway

249
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,287
lots of sparks and flames

250
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,100
50

251
00:15:46,222 --> 00:15:47,222
40

252
00:15:48,744 --> 00:15:49,744
30

253
00:15:56,464 --> 00:15:57,464
race

254
00:16:02,059 --> 00:16:03,759
220 knots in this case

255
00:16:04,301 --> 00:16:06,121
just insane rate of
speed for landing

256
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:10,567
reverse thrust

257
00:16:10,987 --> 00:16:11,987
come on
come on

258
00:16:12,065 --> 00:16:13,065
stop

259
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,140
escort these
passengers off the plane

260
00:16:40,383 --> 00:16:43,580
he's just put this badly
damaged airplane down

261
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:49,024
at about 90 knots faster
than a normal landing speed

262
00:16:49,945 --> 00:16:52,400
this guys is good
he's really good

263
00:16:59,739 --> 00:17:00,739
hoot

264
00:17:01,662 --> 00:17:03,022
it's unbelievable

265
00:17:04,222 --> 00:17:06,627
what the heck went so
wrong with that plane?

266
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,720
I have a faintest idea

267
00:17:16,106 --> 00:17:19,206
investigators from the national
transportation safety board

268
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,960
arrived in Detroit

269
00:17:20,962 --> 00:17:24,663
to determine what went
wrong with TWA flight 841

270
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,500
they look in good shape

271
00:17:30,501 --> 00:17:32,301
let's get the data on these

272
00:17:32,502 --> 00:17:35,302
the flight data recorder
and cockpit voice recorder

273
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,668
are removed from the
aircraft and sent for analysis

274
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:42,359
let's check that out

275
00:17:51,021 --> 00:17:52,021
slat number 7 is missing

276
00:17:56,539 --> 00:18:01,564
slats and flats are control surfaces on
the leading and trailing edges of the wing

277
00:18:02,184 --> 00:18:04,184
they are always
extended in tandem

278
00:18:06,748 --> 00:18:11,821
both devices increase lift at low
speed during take off and landing

279
00:18:16,674 --> 00:18:17,674
it's pretty banged up

280
00:18:18,382 --> 00:18:22,081
investigators wonder
why the slat came off

281
00:18:24,863 --> 00:18:26,963
hydraulic lines are ruptured too

282
00:18:32,142 --> 00:18:34,722
looks like the actuator
for the slat is damaged

283
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:41,422
the actuator is part of a
mechanism that pushes a piston

284
00:18:41,743 --> 00:18:43,043
to unlock the slat

285
00:18:43,183 --> 00:18:45,960
allowing it to either
deploy or retract

286
00:18:46,301 --> 00:18:49,303
let's get the actuator off the wing
so we can get a better look at it

287
00:18:54,459 --> 00:19:00,804
one of the interesting remnants of this
inspections was the number 7 slat actuator

288
00:19:05,379 --> 00:19:07,379
look at how it's broken

289
00:19:13,618 --> 00:19:15,318
and scrape marks inside either

290
00:19:16,181 --> 00:19:18,681
investigators uncover
an important clue

291
00:19:20,379 --> 00:19:22,379
it's like came off
in extended position

292
00:19:25,863 --> 00:19:28,363
number 7 slat
actuator had broken

293
00:19:29,105 --> 00:19:31,105
the piston inside it was gone

294
00:19:31,578 --> 00:19:35,901
and they could recognize from
looking at the opening of the fracture

295
00:19:36,062 --> 00:19:40,139
that the piston had been
in the deployed position

296
00:19:41,701 --> 00:19:44,341
a slat should never
deploy at cruising speed

297
00:19:47,345 --> 00:19:49,345
maybe the slat
extended by accident

298
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,460
only way to know for sure
test hydraulic system

299
00:19:55,539 --> 00:19:58,841
for the slat to have been
deployed uncommanded

300
00:19:58,901 --> 00:20:02,704
required the failure of the hydraulic
system and failure of the locking mechanism

301
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:09,741
I'll start with flaps 2

302
00:20:20,824 --> 00:20:21,824
flaps 15

303
00:20:22,826 --> 00:20:23,826
flaps 15

304
00:20:34,341 --> 00:20:35,341
looks good

305
00:20:35,622 --> 00:20:36,662
next flaps 20

306
00:20:38,463 --> 00:20:39,463
flaps 20

307
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,746
investigators run through
every flap setting possible

308
00:20:47,944 --> 00:20:48,944
alright
let's wrap it up

309
00:20:49,922 --> 00:20:51,422
everything's working fine

310
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,701
the functional test demonstrated
that the hydraulic system worked

311
00:20:55,262 --> 00:20:57,779
it did not cause an
uncommanded slat deployment

312
00:21:00,782 --> 00:21:02,982
this what we've got from Boeing

313
00:21:03,623 --> 00:21:07,266
did the locking mechanism
on the 727's wing somehow fail?

314
00:21:07,538 --> 00:21:09,038
releasing the slat?

315
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,060
for a slat to unlock accidentally

316
00:21:12,542 --> 00:21:16,944
the pin inside the actuator must
be subjected to more than 70 G force

317
00:21:17,899 --> 00:21:18,899
70 G

318
00:21:21,862 --> 00:21:25,945
there's no way the locking mechanism
experience that level of stress

319
00:21:26,025 --> 00:21:29,987
a 70 G pull through by an
aircraft just doesn't happen

320
00:21:32,219 --> 00:21:35,920
the investigators were faced with
the serious challenge of where to go next

321
00:21:43,187 --> 00:21:44,187
take a look

322
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:50,300
investigators get a break when
debris from flight 841 is recovered

323
00:21:50,382 --> 00:21:52,398
7 miles north of
Saginaw Michigan

324
00:21:54,341 --> 00:21:55,841
slat number 7

325
00:21:59,704 --> 00:22:00,704
broken in two

326
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:03,541
look at this

327
00:22:06,223 --> 00:22:08,223
is the number 7 slat t-bolt

328
00:22:10,381 --> 00:22:13,722
t-bolts are part of the
slat track assemblies

329
00:22:13,739 --> 00:22:18,102
the number 7 slat t-bolt was
attach to the in-board side of the slat

330
00:22:18,263 --> 00:22:20,999
which deploys and
retracts inside the wing

331
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,220
let's send this to the lab

332
00:22:24,503 --> 00:22:27,084
they hope metallurgical
analysis will offer some clues

333
00:22:28,184 --> 00:22:30,184
but an important
question remains

334
00:22:30,739 --> 00:22:32,739
why did the slat extend?

335
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,340
there is only one other
way slat could extend

336
00:22:39,742 --> 00:22:41,422
through pilot action

337
00:22:44,181 --> 00:22:48,705
this was something that had been
probably commanded in the cockpit

338
00:22:49,544 --> 00:22:51,544
and a it was
distressing to everybody

339
00:22:53,502 --> 00:22:58,544
why would a pilot do something as dangerous
as extending the slats at cruising speed?

340
00:23:03,141 --> 00:23:05,941
I can't find anything in the
cabin about slats and flaps

341
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,420
investigators review
the crew's statements

342
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:18,082
they look for any mention that flaps
and slats were deployed mid flight

343
00:23:20,303 --> 00:23:22,345
there is nothing from
other crew members either

344
00:23:26,302 --> 00:23:27,422
I have an idea

345
00:23:35,019 --> 00:23:36,819
thanks for meeting with me

346
00:23:36,981 --> 00:23:38,885
the NTSB consult with pilot

347
00:23:38,982 --> 00:23:42,630
to learn why they might
extend the flap or slat mid flight

348
00:23:44,259 --> 00:23:45,879
off the record
off the record

349
00:23:47,341 --> 00:23:49,301
flaps yes
slats no

350
00:23:51,024 --> 00:23:52,024
flaps

351
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:57,382
investigators learned of an unauthorized
procedure used by some pilots

352
00:23:57,622 --> 00:24:00,222
that could save fuel
and potentially time

353
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:04,050
I thought that was impossible

354
00:24:04,421 --> 00:24:05,421
it is

355
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,361
if you pop the breaker

356
00:24:11,459 --> 00:24:16,339
the procedure involves deploying
trailing edge flaps by two degrees

357
00:24:16,699 --> 00:24:18,699
by pulling the circuit
breaker for slats

358
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:21,201
the flaps can be extended

359
00:24:21,222 --> 00:24:25,766
while preventing the slats from
automatically deploying at the same time

360
00:24:27,381 --> 00:24:29,382
just one of those things
every body knows about

361
00:24:29,942 --> 00:24:33,124
but I've never heard
anyone ever admit to it

362
00:24:37,221 --> 00:24:38,221
ready

363
00:24:40,343 --> 00:24:42,904
instigators turn to the
cockpit voice recorder

364
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:48,099
for evidence that TWA 841's pilots
used the unauthorized procedure

365
00:24:50,661 --> 00:24:52,602
escort these
passengers off the plane

366
00:24:53,714 --> 00:24:54,714
hang on

367
00:24:55,099 --> 00:24:57,340
did you start the
tape at the beginning?

368
00:25:00,183 --> 00:25:01,883
yes, it's fully rewound

369
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,820
play again
just to make sure

370
00:25:16,501 --> 00:25:18,968
escort these
passengers off the plane

371
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,580
plane is already on the ground

372
00:25:26,342 --> 00:25:28,242
this can only point to one thing

373
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,420
the pilots erased the tape

374
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,140
the CVR contained no
information whatsoever

375
00:25:43,101 --> 00:25:44,901
which was unfortunate
to say at least

376
00:25:54,862 --> 00:25:56,362
we have to talk to Gibson

377
00:25:58,819 --> 00:26:02,820
the team flies to California to
question captain Gibson in person

378
00:26:08,586 --> 00:26:10,686
the safety board
conduct public hearings

379
00:26:12,501 --> 00:26:14,001
they questioned the flight crew

380
00:26:15,982 --> 00:26:17,982
I told and I thought it was
I said

381
00:26:18,825 --> 00:26:20,825
I said the airplane
is gonna roll

382
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,180
and the

383
00:26:26,383 --> 00:26:31,565
the captain admits to routinely erasing the
cockpit voice recorder after every flight

384
00:26:31,865 --> 00:26:34,539
even though that isn't
step on any checklist

385
00:26:37,702 --> 00:26:39,702
do you usually
erase the recorder?

386
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:41,723
I usually do
yes

387
00:26:52,023 --> 00:26:53,523
it's just not credible

388
00:26:54,265 --> 00:26:57,320
the after the crew had
been through what they did

389
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,760
where they came
within seconds of dying

390
00:27:00,182 --> 00:27:04,939
that the captain wanna erase the
CVR as a matter of habit or routine

391
00:27:08,062 --> 00:27:10,062
something is wrong here

392
00:27:10,299 --> 00:27:14,942
captain Gibson's vague explanation
doesn't sit well with investigators

393
00:27:15,379 --> 00:27:19,902
given what happened they suspect the flight
crew attempted the unsanctioned procedure

394
00:27:20,743 --> 00:27:23,028
and then try to
cover up their actions

395
00:27:25,541 --> 00:27:30,041
the only reason he would erase
the CVR was to keep information

396
00:27:30,543 --> 00:27:32,643
from what he knew
would be an investigation

397
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,181
investigators believed
he had something to hide

398
00:27:45,383 --> 00:27:47,683
maybe the FDR
data can tell us more

399
00:27:49,065 --> 00:27:52,578
the team studies
TWA 841 flight data

400
00:27:52,698 --> 00:27:57,502
to uncover any evidence that the
crew attempted a mid flight flap extension

401
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,460
wow three picks up speed

402
00:28:06,102 --> 00:28:12,202
in 44 seconds the plane goes
from 229 knots to over 400 knots

403
00:28:15,103 --> 00:28:16,503
it's incredible

404
00:28:20,183 --> 00:28:21,183
look at this

405
00:28:21,623 --> 00:28:25,628
close inspection of the data
gives the team an important clue

406
00:28:25,999 --> 00:28:26,999
it's odd

407
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,700
are those oscillations?

408
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,200
yes in the G-trace

409
00:28:30,703 --> 00:28:32,803
the G-trace shows
the level of G forces

410
00:28:32,984 --> 00:28:35,884
being put on the plane
through out the flight

411
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,660
let's get this section blown up

412
00:28:39,461 --> 00:28:42,282
the G-trace showed
the G-force of the airplane

413
00:28:42,522 --> 00:28:45,560
were sort of increasing and
decreasing in a certain rhythmic pattern

414
00:28:46,302 --> 00:28:47,802
very very unusual

415
00:28:50,259 --> 00:28:56,044
oscillation start 39,000
feet just before the upset

416
00:28:58,939 --> 00:29:02,139
it showed up one two three
13 seconds before the roll starts

417
00:29:04,863 --> 00:29:07,863
looks like the plane was
really bouncing around

418
00:29:11,869 --> 00:29:12,869
what the heck?

419
00:29:12,879 --> 00:29:16,479
the data tells investigators that
the plane was moving erratically

420
00:29:16,541 --> 00:29:18,941
for 13 seconds
before the first roll

421
00:29:21,582 --> 00:29:22,582
here is thought

422
00:29:25,544 --> 00:29:27,744
what if there is flap
and slat configuration

423
00:29:27,826 --> 00:29:29,826
that could cause the vibration

424
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,681
let's find out

425
00:29:39,381 --> 00:29:41,381
we've reached 39,000 feet

426
00:29:42,223 --> 00:29:44,923
NTSB investigators take
an unprecedented risk

427
00:29:45,588 --> 00:29:50,863
in an attempt to replicate the
oscillations recorded on TWA 841's G-trace

428
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:57,282
okay we've got more than a
dozen configurations and maneuvers

429
00:29:58,543 --> 00:29:59,843
they run a test flight

430
00:29:59,984 --> 00:30:04,764
to determine if these anomalies
resulted from a mid flight slat extension

431
00:30:05,021 --> 00:30:08,321
conducting a flight test would
enable them to perform a maneuvers

432
00:30:08,423 --> 00:30:13,467
that could be compared to what the
flight data recorder recorded on 841

433
00:30:14,581 --> 00:30:15,981
229 knots

434
00:30:16,342 --> 00:30:18,342
okay test number one

435
00:30:19,147 --> 00:30:20,847
start by popping the breaker

436
00:30:24,342 --> 00:30:25,942
okay slats are retracted

437
00:30:26,618 --> 00:30:27,618
ready

438
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,580
flaps two

439
00:30:31,982 --> 00:30:32,982
flaps two

440
00:30:33,423 --> 00:30:36,485
investigators try to match
the unusual oscillations

441
00:30:36,582 --> 00:30:39,282
by testing different flaps
and slat configuration

442
00:30:42,947 --> 00:30:43,947
test number two

443
00:30:44,939 --> 00:30:47,539
flaps five
slats remain retracted

444
00:30:49,743 --> 00:30:51,743
NTSB investigators
they'll do anything

445
00:30:52,024 --> 00:30:53,024
they love that stuff

446
00:30:53,186 --> 00:30:55,686
but I would have
been pretty scared

447
00:31:00,304 --> 00:31:01,804
okay test number 9

448
00:31:02,545 --> 00:31:06,080
flaps two slats two
three six and seven

449
00:31:07,301 --> 00:31:08,301
flaps two
ready

450
00:31:16,306 --> 00:31:17,666
do you feel that?

451
00:31:17,698 --> 00:31:21,401
the flight test gives investigators
a tantalizing new lead

452
00:31:24,183 --> 00:31:26,866
investigators are very
careful with flight test

453
00:31:27,025 --> 00:31:31,125
to take the same aircraft to
record parameters carefully

454
00:31:31,141 --> 00:31:33,923
all those things have
to factor into a flight test

455
00:31:34,222 --> 00:31:37,364
in order to be a very
use to the investigation

456
00:31:44,062 --> 00:31:46,062
here is the data from the test

457
00:31:46,344 --> 00:31:49,244
scenario number
9 should match up

458
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:55,864
to confirm their results, investigators
compare the data with the FDR G-trace

459
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,120
it's perfect match

460
00:32:00,141 --> 00:32:03,741
the flight has showed that
extending the flaps and slats

461
00:32:03,905 --> 00:32:07,760
would create in the airplane
oscillations found on 841

462
00:32:08,941 --> 00:32:11,703
so this was the test when
plane was shaking the most

463
00:32:12,303 --> 00:32:13,303
this is the one

464
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:16,980
flaps two

465
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:21,424
slats two, three, six
and seven deployed

466
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,340
and are retracted
13 seconds later

467
00:32:26,183 --> 00:32:30,183
they now have evidence
that TWA 841's crew

468
00:32:30,338 --> 00:32:34,421
enact the unauthorized procedure
of pulling a slat circuit breaker

469
00:32:34,541 --> 00:32:37,244
and then deploying
the flaps independently

470
00:32:38,184 --> 00:32:40,184
but if that's what the crew did

471
00:32:40,739 --> 00:32:42,239
why did the slats deploy?

472
00:32:42,281 --> 00:32:43,981
and nearly bring down the plane

473
00:32:48,185 --> 00:32:49,185
what the heck?

474
00:32:51,859 --> 00:32:57,181
the slats are gonna shake because you're
going faster than the limiting airspeed

475
00:32:57,343 --> 00:33:01,386
so I would expect it to get very
noisy and probably to buff it quite a bit

476
00:33:04,621 --> 00:33:08,219
the test flight indicates the
slats circuit breaker was reset

477
00:33:08,301 --> 00:33:10,301
which cause the slats to deploy

478
00:33:11,142 --> 00:33:14,700
so we know the pilots popped the
breaker to in enact the procedure

479
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:18,680
but why they did
push it back in?

480
00:33:20,701 --> 00:33:23,502
why did it take the crew 13
seconds to realize the problem?

481
00:33:23,503 --> 00:33:25,803
and then retract the slats

482
00:33:29,147 --> 00:33:32,579
investigators searched for answers
in all of the crew's statements

483
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,488
the lead flight
attendant remembered

484
00:33:38,504 --> 00:33:41,700
that the flight engineer was out of
the cockpit before the vibrations began

485
00:33:43,501 --> 00:33:44,621
let's see that

486
00:33:47,144 --> 00:33:49,945
I'm gonna take a bathroom
break and get rid of these trays

487
00:33:57,779 --> 00:33:59,179
I notice the cockpit door open

488
00:33:59,221 --> 00:34:02,297
and I saw the flight engineer
coming out with the meal trays

489
00:34:02,303 --> 00:34:05,364
I didn't want to think I was
shirking my responsibilities

490
00:34:05,385 --> 00:34:06,385
I immediately met him

491
00:34:09,187 --> 00:34:10,187
let me get these for you

492
00:34:10,899 --> 00:34:11,899
thank you

493
00:34:11,939 --> 00:34:14,419
I was kind of
surprise I've never had

494
00:34:14,501 --> 00:34:18,144
a cockpit member actually
bring those trays back to the cabin

495
00:34:18,465 --> 00:34:19,965
they waited for us

496
00:34:22,941 --> 00:34:23,941
that's it

497
00:34:24,381 --> 00:34:26,881
the flight engineer
was out of the cockpit

498
00:34:27,738 --> 00:34:28,738
and out of the loop

499
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:31,681
investigators now have a theory

500
00:34:31,742 --> 00:34:35,774
about what happened in the
cockpit on the night of April the 4th

501
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:40,701
flight engineer leaves the
cockpit to return the trays

502
00:34:43,501 --> 00:34:45,501
with Banks out of the cockpit

503
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:47,701
Gibson launches
unauthorized procedure

504
00:34:48,063 --> 00:34:50,063
the pilots deploy the flaps

505
00:34:53,142 --> 00:34:55,664
what do you say we get to
Minneapolis a little quicker?

506
00:34:56,505 --> 00:34:57,505
okay

507
00:34:57,907 --> 00:34:59,507
how we're gonna do that?

508
00:34:59,628 --> 00:35:00,628
watch this

509
00:35:22,501 --> 00:35:23,501
flaps 2

510
00:35:25,583 --> 00:35:26,583
fancy trick

511
00:35:27,064 --> 00:35:29,144
heard about it but
I've never tried it

512
00:35:32,139 --> 00:35:34,941
I could see, the junior crew
members saying he is the boss

513
00:35:35,261 --> 00:35:36,261
let's do it

514
00:35:36,703 --> 00:35:38,503
he says it's okay
it's okay

515
00:35:38,984 --> 00:35:40,984
today that would be unthinkable

516
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:47,098
flight engineer returns and
notices a breaker is popped

517
00:35:48,781 --> 00:35:50,882
what would any good
flight engineer do?

518
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:53,899
it pushes it back in

519
00:35:55,021 --> 00:35:59,619
flight engineer banks returns and
notices the slat circuit breaker is pulled

520
00:36:00,581 --> 00:36:03,101
he returns the breaker
to the normal position

521
00:36:03,422 --> 00:36:06,024
unaware that the captain
had pulled it deliberately

522
00:36:06,224 --> 00:36:08,779
to prevent the slats from
extending along with the flaps

523
00:36:10,741 --> 00:36:11,741
exactly

524
00:36:12,542 --> 00:36:14,042
normal operations resume

525
00:36:14,783 --> 00:36:18,139
with flaps set for two
slats extend automatically

526
00:36:19,262 --> 00:36:20,762
the cockpit begins to vibrate

527
00:36:23,984 --> 00:36:25,104
what the heck?

528
00:36:25,425 --> 00:36:27,105
what did you just do?

529
00:36:27,707 --> 00:36:29,067
what do you mean?

530
00:36:29,147 --> 00:36:30,147
just now

531
00:36:30,227 --> 00:36:31,227
what did you just do?

532
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:35,540
breaker was popped up
push it back where it should be

533
00:36:35,581 --> 00:36:36,581
Jesus

534
00:36:37,022 --> 00:36:39,022
flaps up
Scott

535
00:36:39,305 --> 00:36:40,305
flaps up

536
00:36:44,458 --> 00:36:45,458
we're going reverse

537
00:36:50,342 --> 00:36:51,642
investigators have figured out

538
00:36:51,783 --> 00:36:56,678
how TWA 841's crew might
have lost control of the Boeing 727

539
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:01,261
but they're still missing a
key piece of the puzzle

540
00:37:01,583 --> 00:37:05,640
how come slat number 7 never
retracted along with the rest of the slats?

541
00:37:13,065 --> 00:37:15,065
metallurgical report is in

542
00:37:16,698 --> 00:37:20,798
investigators turn to results from
a metallurgical analysis of the t-bolt

543
00:37:20,902 --> 00:37:24,684
from the number 7
slat on TWA flight 841

544
00:37:32,303 --> 00:37:33,803
he found some shrink

545
00:37:35,705 --> 00:37:37,605
preexisting metal fatigue

546
00:37:40,421 --> 00:37:43,421
the team discovers
a fracture in the t-bolt

547
00:37:43,538 --> 00:37:46,881
which would have caused the the
slat to sag on the inside when extended

548
00:37:48,662 --> 00:37:51,785
the slat is kept in the
forward part of the wing

549
00:37:52,346 --> 00:37:56,482
which gets all of the air forces
as the airplane progresses

550
00:37:57,102 --> 00:38:01,642
at point 8 times speed of sound
that's gonna hit enormous air pressure

551
00:38:02,623 --> 00:38:05,765
so all that air pressure
twists the sagged slat

552
00:38:08,499 --> 00:38:11,362
slat number 7 can
no longer retract

553
00:38:13,703 --> 00:38:16,384
under the extreme air
loads of a diving plane

554
00:38:16,787 --> 00:38:18,687
it finally rips off

555
00:38:21,262 --> 00:38:23,701
investigators finally understand

556
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:28,944
how TWA 841 went into a horrifying
dive above Saginaw Michigan

557
00:38:29,064 --> 00:38:31,064
on the night of
the April 4th 1979

558
00:38:32,179 --> 00:38:34,679
I'm gonna take a bathroom break
I'll grab these trays

559
00:38:40,748 --> 00:38:43,979
unaware the captain was
conducting an unsanctioned procedure

560
00:38:44,419 --> 00:38:48,642
disengaging the slats circuit
breaker to deploy only the flaps

561
00:38:49,184 --> 00:38:51,886
the flight engineer
resets the popped breaker

562
00:39:04,866 --> 00:39:06,246
what did you just do?

563
00:39:06,308 --> 00:39:07,308
what do you mean?

564
00:39:08,859 --> 00:39:12,762
pressure seconds passed as the captain
tries to figured out what's happened

565
00:39:13,662 --> 00:39:16,562
meanwhile the aircraft
flies at a high speed

566
00:39:16,625 --> 00:39:19,139
with its flaps and slats
extended perilously

567
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:22,780
the captain, passengers and
flight attendants start to the

568
00:39:22,942 --> 00:39:24,622
feeling the vibration
of the airplane

569
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:28,306
caused by extension of the
slats and flaps at 39,000 feet

570
00:39:29,426 --> 00:39:30,926
flaps up
flaps up Scot

571
00:39:31,428 --> 00:39:32,428
flaps up

572
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,500
I have control

573
00:39:35,902 --> 00:39:37,802
the flaps and slats retract

574
00:39:37,863 --> 00:39:41,305
except for the damaged
number 7 slat on the right wing

575
00:39:42,379 --> 00:39:44,479
the number 7
slat if it's extended

576
00:39:44,941 --> 00:39:48,843
you're gonna have more drag on
the right side than on the left wing

577
00:39:48,903 --> 00:39:50,603
and that's gonna cause
that wing to descent

578
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:53,080
in other words it's gonna
put the airplane in a right turn

579
00:39:53,221 --> 00:39:55,021
which is exactly what happened

580
00:39:55,222 --> 00:39:56,722
come on
level up

581
00:39:58,905 --> 00:39:59,905
but it's too late

582
00:40:00,626 --> 00:40:02,326
little does the crew know

583
00:40:02,347 --> 00:40:04,347
slat number 7 is still extended

584
00:40:04,579 --> 00:40:06,379
keeping the plane in a roll

585
00:40:07,141 --> 00:40:08,141
we're going reverse

586
00:40:09,382 --> 00:40:14,179
TWA 841's flight crew is unable
to regain control of the aircraft

587
00:40:16,422 --> 00:40:18,622
then in a stroke of
incredible good luck

588
00:40:18,984 --> 00:40:22,665
slats number 7 rips off the plane
just 8,000 feet above the ground

589
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:31,303
the departure of the slat allowed the
return of control ability to the aircraft

590
00:40:32,183 --> 00:40:34,583
with the wing symmetry
partially restored

591
00:40:34,984 --> 00:40:37,084
and the landing gear deployed

592
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:41,121
it's just enough to slow the plane
and allowed the crew to regain control

593
00:40:42,464 --> 00:40:45,927
and ultimately land the
battered 727 at Detroit

594
00:40:48,899 --> 00:40:50,019
reverse thrust

595
00:40:58,299 --> 00:41:01,599
the NTSB recommends
additional warnings to flight crews

596
00:41:01,983 --> 00:41:06,226
about the dangers of high speed
deployment of flaps and slats

597
00:41:07,026 --> 00:41:09,026
no punitive action is
taken against the crew

598
00:41:11,781 --> 00:41:14,981
NTSB conclusions
are not a criminal thing

599
00:41:15,182 --> 00:41:16,882
there not a blamed thing

600
00:41:16,905 --> 00:41:19,359
they're trying to
prevent the next accident

601
00:41:19,418 --> 00:41:23,943
by offering up a probable
cause that needs to be corrected

602
00:41:29,218 --> 00:41:31,718
the pilots maintained
their innocents

603
00:41:32,021 --> 00:41:35,140
claiming they did not deliberately
extend the flaps mid flight

604
00:41:36,262 --> 00:41:39,482
captain Gibson took it to
his grave with him in 2015

605
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,000
the other two
guys aren't talking

606
00:41:44,424 --> 00:41:45,724
following this accident

607
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:48,895
newer planes now come
equipped with flight computers

608
00:41:49,021 --> 00:41:52,301
that prevent the deployment of
flaps and slats above certain altitudes

609
00:41:56,022 --> 00:41:59,383
their speculation over
manipulation of controls

610
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:00,984
all that sort of thing

611
00:42:01,379 --> 00:42:04,441
I've given a great deal of
thought over the past 41 years

612
00:42:05,342 --> 00:42:08,959
and have come with the conclusion
that I'll never know what happened
