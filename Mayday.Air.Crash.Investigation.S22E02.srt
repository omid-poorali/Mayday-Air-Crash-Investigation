1
00:00:00,823 --> 00:00:02,323
Martin-air Flight 495

2
00:00:02,983 --> 00:00:05,163
is minutes from
landing at Faro Portugal

3
00:00:06,902 --> 00:00:09,602
the left engine was
making a rattling sound

4
00:00:10,587 --> 00:00:13,087
all of a sudden we
heard an enormous bang

5
00:00:17,905 --> 00:00:19,405
it was total destruction

6
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:23,563
56 people are dead

7
00:00:26,027 --> 00:00:27,027
wow
look at this

8
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:30,970
investigators quickly find some
intriguing evidence of the crash site

9
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:33,325
there was a 2 inch deep cut

10
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,553
down the left side of the runway

11
00:00:37,783 --> 00:00:38,783
this is very strange

12
00:00:40,066 --> 00:00:42,022
the landing gear is
completely severed

13
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:44,601
if the aircraft were overweight

14
00:00:44,903 --> 00:00:46,903
it could exceed the design limit

15
00:00:47,093 --> 00:00:48,793
causing it to break and shear

16
00:00:49,942 --> 00:00:53,460
these guys were 71000
pounds underweight

17
00:00:54,745 --> 00:00:56,265
it wasn't too heavy

18
00:00:56,462 --> 00:00:57,982
so what went wrong?

19
00:01:19,986 --> 00:01:23,486
Martin-air Flight 495 is
nearing Portugal southern coast

20
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,200
approach
Martin-air Flight 495

21
00:01:29,225 --> 00:01:30,225
good morning

22
00:01:30,664 --> 00:01:33,164
the captain is 56 year
old H. W. van Staveren

23
00:01:35,383 --> 00:01:36,383
75 DME

24
00:01:36,822 --> 00:01:38,322
and out of 2404
level 70

25
00:01:39,904 --> 00:01:42,404
a highly experienced
pilot and flight instructor

26
00:01:43,027 --> 00:01:45,727
he's been with
Martin-air for 24 years

27
00:01:46,383 --> 00:01:47,883
descending to level 70

28
00:01:48,581 --> 00:01:51,584
the first officer is 31 year old
R. J. Clemenkowff

29
00:01:53,065 --> 00:01:55,746
he's been flying with the
dutch company for 3 years

30
00:01:58,383 --> 00:02:02,183
the youngest member of the team is
29 year old flight engineer Gary Glans

31
00:02:05,622 --> 00:02:07,763
it was our last flight before
the Christmas holidays

32
00:02:08,184 --> 00:02:09,784
everyone was in a good mood

33
00:02:11,304 --> 00:02:12,304
my job as flight engineer

34
00:02:12,744 --> 00:02:14,802
I'm responsible for
the aircraft in general

35
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:16,985
to make sure that everything
is operating properly

36
00:02:17,386 --> 00:02:21,221
and overall trying to be a third
set of eyes for the flying pilots

37
00:02:23,265 --> 00:02:24,765
the crew is flying a DC-10

38
00:02:25,544 --> 00:02:27,244
a three engine wide body jet

39
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:30,649
in the 19th the DC-10

40
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:35,065
was one of the type of aircraft
most used for operators world wide

41
00:02:36,587 --> 00:02:39,187
they're now less than
half of hour from landing

42
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:45,162
there are 13 crew members
and 327 passengers on board

43
00:02:46,944 --> 00:02:48,944
most are residents
of the Netherlands

44
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,102
we were heading for
a vocation for weekend

45
00:02:53,102 --> 00:02:55,402
the south of particle
of the Algarve

46
00:02:56,462 --> 00:02:58,542
going to warmer
weather than Netherlands

47
00:02:58,704 --> 00:03:00,504
and fleeing busy year we had

48
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:07,464
flight 495 is near the
end of 2.5 hour trip

49
00:03:07,464 --> 00:03:10,141
from Amsterdam to
Portugal’s Faro airport

50
00:03:13,066 --> 00:03:14,906
8 letter word for apple sources

51
00:03:18,429 --> 00:03:19,429
orchards

52
00:03:21,265 --> 00:03:22,265
I was traveling with evol

53
00:03:22,704 --> 00:03:24,637
then my girlfriend
now my wife

54
00:03:25,268 --> 00:03:27,626
I was lucky we could
sit at the front row

55
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,223
so I had a lot of leg
space to move around

56
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:34,666
oh

57
00:03:36,187 --> 00:03:39,020
raining cats and dogs over there

58
00:03:40,151 --> 00:03:42,151
as they descends
towards Faro airport

59
00:03:42,463 --> 00:03:45,062
the pilots expect to
encounter some bad weather

60
00:03:46,144 --> 00:03:48,844
we knew that we're going
to encounter rain-showers

61
00:03:50,346 --> 00:03:53,246
thunderstorm or something that
you have to incredibly aware of

62
00:03:53,985 --> 00:03:56,580
and ensure that they
don't effect your flight path

63
00:03:57,901 --> 00:03:59,901
we do everything to avoid them

64
00:04:00,183 --> 00:04:03,227
because they can produce
unexpected wind-changes

65
00:04:03,304 --> 00:04:04,984
micro-burst
wind-shears

66
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:08,563
when a thunderstorm
moves over an active runway

67
00:04:09,181 --> 00:04:12,001
the potential for wind shear
can make it too dangerous

68
00:04:12,144 --> 00:04:13,144
for an aircraft to land

69
00:04:14,145 --> 00:04:17,222
it wasn't something that we
felt was going to be a major issue

70
00:04:17,262 --> 00:04:19,262
it's just something to monitor

71
00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:24,419
if the weather worsens

72
00:04:24,581 --> 00:04:26,381
they can divert north to Lisbon

73
00:04:27,265 --> 00:04:29,065
but right now
it isn't necessary

74
00:04:30,387 --> 00:04:31,987
Martin-air 461
runway visual

75
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,764
just minutes ahead another
Martin-air flight is landing at Faro

76
00:04:40,265 --> 00:04:41,765
clear to land runway 11

77
00:04:45,305 --> 00:04:47,705
the weather report indicates
that closest thunderstorm

78
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,070
is approximately 7 miles
to the west of the runway

79
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:54,786
knowing other airplanes
were flying that same approach

80
00:04:55,184 --> 00:04:57,184
and nobody had reported
any significant issues

81
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:00,764
made us feel, we were
safe to continue onwards

82
00:05:01,631 --> 00:05:03,131
495 is turning inbound

83
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,263
8 miles out

84
00:05:06,445 --> 00:05:10,069
Martin-air 495 starts its
final approach to runway 11

85
00:05:12,903 --> 00:05:14,703
the captain chose to
be the pilot monitoring

86
00:05:14,745 --> 00:05:16,745
so he could oversee
the whole approach

87
00:05:17,302 --> 00:05:20,822
and let the first officer
focus on just flying the aircraft

88
00:05:23,508 --> 00:05:25,508
they descend
into the rain-clouds

89
00:05:25,786 --> 00:05:28,580
confident the nearest
thunderstorm is still miles away

90
00:05:47,427 --> 00:05:49,940
495, report at minimum
some runway insight

91
00:05:51,061 --> 00:05:53,061
runway surface
conditions are flood

92
00:05:53,862 --> 00:05:54,862
roger
495

93
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:57,648
with wet runway conditions

94
00:05:57,826 --> 00:06:01,521
the crew configures the plane to
make what's called a positive landing

95
00:06:02,224 --> 00:06:04,980
a positive touchdown
is when the main wheels

96
00:06:05,024 --> 00:06:07,624
penetrate the water
layer on the runway

97
00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:10,323
and improve the stopping
ability of the aircraft

98
00:06:10,942 --> 00:06:11,942
gear down

99
00:06:13,905 --> 00:06:14,905
gear down

100
00:06:16,828 --> 00:06:17,828
with a wet runway

101
00:06:18,267 --> 00:06:21,447
you do wanna touchdown
at positive firm rate

102
00:06:21,487 --> 00:06:24,507
rather than trying to float
down for a softer touchdown

103
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:26,185
altimeters

104
00:06:27,739 --> 00:06:28,739
set 3 times

105
00:06:29,746 --> 00:06:30,746
4 miles from touchdown

106
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:33,183
the pilots make
their final checks

107
00:06:33,748 --> 00:06:34,748
spoilers

108
00:06:37,543 --> 00:06:38,543
armed

109
00:06:39,067 --> 00:06:40,067
flaps
slats

110
00:06:42,465 --> 00:06:43,465
flap zero
land

111
00:06:48,902 --> 00:06:51,407
the left engine was
making quite a noise

112
00:06:52,264 --> 00:06:53,264
and a rattling sound

113
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,705
every time it came full power

114
00:06:57,382 --> 00:06:59,801
the plane was pitching
up and pitching down

115
00:07:02,744 --> 00:07:04,344
so that was not reassuring

116
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:09,286
Martin-air 495
clear to land runway 11

117
00:07:09,543 --> 00:07:10,543
the winds
150

118
00:07:11,266 --> 00:07:12,266
15 knots
maximum 20

119
00:07:20,005 --> 00:07:21,005
clear to land

120
00:07:22,027 --> 00:07:25,045
flight 495 is less than a
minute from touching down

121
00:07:27,108 --> 00:07:29,108
when the weather gets much worse

122
00:07:30,789 --> 00:07:31,789
windshield went to ice

123
00:07:32,226 --> 00:07:33,726
I can't see anything
I'm on it

124
00:07:34,743 --> 00:07:35,743
wipers run fast

125
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,180
I was squeezing hands

126
00:07:50,302 --> 00:07:51,802
firmer and firmer with evol

127
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,990
it was dead quite into plane

128
00:08:04,186 --> 00:08:07,103
the plane is now just a
few seconds from landing

129
00:08:10,903 --> 00:08:11,943
all of sudden

130
00:08:11,967 --> 00:08:13,400
we heard an enormous bang

131
00:08:19,382 --> 00:08:20,882
I fell out of the chair

132
00:08:21,787 --> 00:08:23,487
then I saw the kitchen
doors into pieces

133
00:08:30,224 --> 00:08:32,224
I was pretty sure we
were gonna be crush

134
00:08:36,206 --> 00:08:40,731
flight 495 slides more than 350
feet off the runway at Faro airport

135
00:08:43,264 --> 00:08:45,741
fire fighter and rescue
crews raced to the site

136
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:53,896
incredibly many of the
passengers and the flight crew

137
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:54,901
survived

138
00:08:55,742 --> 00:08:58,888
there were people screaming
and crying and running

139
00:09:04,742 --> 00:09:06,242
I didn't see my girlfriend

140
00:09:07,305 --> 00:09:09,805
my first thought was oh, I
won't ever see evol again

141
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,001
those lucky enough to escape

142
00:09:14,023 --> 00:09:15,023
search for loved ones

143
00:09:18,463 --> 00:09:19,663
all of a sudden

144
00:09:19,905 --> 00:09:21,105
I heard my name

145
00:09:23,345 --> 00:09:24,345
then I saw in a distance

146
00:09:24,507 --> 00:09:25,507
I saw evol downing there

147
00:09:28,144 --> 00:09:29,664
we found each other

148
00:09:31,546 --> 00:09:33,546
the injured are taken
to nearby hospitals

149
00:09:39,864 --> 00:09:41,864
of the 340 people on board

150
00:09:42,674 --> 00:09:46,195
54 passengers and 2 cabin
crew members are dead

151
00:09:48,825 --> 00:09:52,893
making this one of Portugal’s worst
aviation disaster in more than a decade

152
00:09:55,586 --> 00:09:57,286
a detail investigation
is now underway

153
00:09:57,542 --> 00:09:59,542
into why this
plane hit the tarmac

154
00:09:59,825 --> 00:10:00,825
and burst into flames

155
00:10:10,466 --> 00:10:12,766
see if we can find
the flight recorders

156
00:10:13,267 --> 00:10:14,267
got it

157
00:10:15,099 --> 00:10:18,144
investigators from Portugal’s
general directorate of civil aviation

158
00:10:19,064 --> 00:10:21,164
and from the American NTSB

159
00:10:21,306 --> 00:10:24,922
arrived to inspect the
wreckage of Martin-air Flight 495

160
00:10:25,784 --> 00:10:27,784
a DC-10 is a big aircraft

161
00:10:27,784 --> 00:10:30,784
and there were pieces of it
all around

162
00:10:31,425 --> 00:10:34,485
the right wing dislodge
from the rest of the aircraft

163
00:10:36,462 --> 00:10:40,043
the wing structure is the
strongest structure on whole aircraft

164
00:10:40,344 --> 00:10:44,365
so it had to have major amount
of stress to make that wing depart

165
00:10:45,748 --> 00:10:46,748
amazing so many survived

166
00:10:49,105 --> 00:10:52,724
the wreckage showed that the
aircraft was mostly destroyed by fire

167
00:10:54,101 --> 00:10:58,108
80 to 90 percent of the people
died from the post impact fire

168
00:10:59,985 --> 00:11:04,071
we were very concerned because if you
have something that suspect on an aircraft

169
00:11:04,758 --> 00:11:07,003
that's been flown
all over the world

170
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,180
you wanna find it

171
00:11:08,343 --> 00:11:09,943
that's great
nice work

172
00:11:13,985 --> 00:11:16,005
let's hope we get
the data back quickly

173
00:11:16,507 --> 00:11:18,707
investigators recover
the black boxes

174
00:11:18,802 --> 00:11:21,566
containing the flight data
recorder and cockpit voice recorder

175
00:11:23,185 --> 00:11:24,785
we needed to try to understand

176
00:11:24,826 --> 00:11:27,398
what happened in the
final moments of the flight

177
00:11:27,449 --> 00:11:29,649
in terms of speed
in terms of decisions

178
00:11:29,711 --> 00:11:32,213
and also what happened
just before the touchdown

179
00:11:38,944 --> 00:11:40,224
wow
look at this

180
00:11:40,626 --> 00:11:42,987
a quarter of a mile from
the runway threshold

181
00:11:43,157 --> 00:11:46,222
investigators discover the
aircraft's initial point of impact

182
00:11:46,783 --> 00:11:48,783
there was a 2 inch deep cut

183
00:11:49,862 --> 00:11:52,362
down the left side of the runway

184
00:11:52,705 --> 00:11:53,705
it hit here

185
00:11:54,384 --> 00:11:56,024
and veered off to the right

186
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,100
it's deep

187
00:11:57,265 --> 00:11:58,265
it must come down hard

188
00:12:01,983 --> 00:12:04,507
scratches we saw on
the runway revealed to us

189
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,820
that plane had landed very hard

190
00:12:07,104 --> 00:12:08,807
so that's why the
marks were deep

191
00:12:09,306 --> 00:12:11,306
maybe one of the engines failed

192
00:12:11,867 --> 00:12:13,867
why did the plane land so hard?

193
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:16,359
was it a problem
with landing gear?

194
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,260
was it the a with speed?

195
00:12:18,463 --> 00:12:20,106
or was it a problem with engine?

196
00:12:20,167 --> 00:12:21,562
so we need to investigate that

197
00:12:24,066 --> 00:12:25,666
is that all of them?

198
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:26,787
see what we've got

199
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:29,379
you always look at the engines

200
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:31,782
and there was substantial damage

201
00:12:34,342 --> 00:12:35,342
we had to determine

202
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:37,904
was there some
kind of malfunction?

203
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:39,341
in the engine

204
00:12:41,185 --> 00:12:44,986
investigators examine a key
component from the engines oil block

205
00:12:45,106 --> 00:12:46,806
called a magnetic chip detector

206
00:12:48,981 --> 00:12:52,581
a magnetic chip detector is
a small cylinder shape device

207
00:12:52,663 --> 00:12:55,163
located inside the
engines oil filter

208
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,460
when an engine part wears

209
00:12:57,745 --> 00:13:02,808
pieces or chips of broken metal adhere to a
magnet as they pass through the oil filter

210
00:13:04,223 --> 00:13:05,723
it's known as making metal

211
00:13:06,224 --> 00:13:09,246
wires the more metal on
this detector than expected

212
00:13:10,467 --> 00:13:12,223
what part of the
engine is wearing?

213
00:13:13,303 --> 00:13:15,303
the alloys are slightly different

214
00:13:15,306 --> 00:13:17,106
they were at different rates

215
00:13:17,281 --> 00:13:19,942
so they can tell by
laboratory analysis

216
00:13:20,422 --> 00:13:22,444
what part of the
engine is wearing

217
00:13:22,526 --> 00:13:23,526
and how rapidly

218
00:13:24,264 --> 00:13:25,764
it's so clean
no chips

219
00:13:28,222 --> 00:13:31,822
there is no evidence of metallic
debris inside the oil system

220
00:13:35,222 --> 00:13:36,222
engines look fine

221
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,882
from the tests
conducted on the engines

222
00:13:39,745 --> 00:13:43,541
it was concluded that the engines
did not contribute to the accident

223
00:13:44,822 --> 00:13:46,722
at this point of investigation

224
00:13:46,781 --> 00:13:49,623
we really didn't have a good
idea of what to look for next

225
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,160
we just had to keep going

226
00:14:01,023 --> 00:14:02,023
this is very strange

227
00:14:03,305 --> 00:14:06,186
they soon realize that
part of the right landing gear

228
00:14:06,386 --> 00:14:07,386
is broken

229
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:12,063
the fact that part of the
right landing gear fractured

230
00:14:12,425 --> 00:14:13,425
is very unusual

231
00:14:13,865 --> 00:14:15,961
it's almost impossible
to make it fail

232
00:14:16,704 --> 00:14:19,422
the forces necessary to
shear the landing gear like that

233
00:14:20,104 --> 00:14:21,104
is massive

234
00:14:22,743 --> 00:14:25,543
landing gear is
design and tested

235
00:14:25,582 --> 00:14:28,815
to be able to withstand
the shock of 200 ton landing

236
00:14:29,224 --> 00:14:30,824
it should never fracture

237
00:14:32,862 --> 00:14:36,462
we had to confirm weather there
was something wrong with that gear

238
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,500
and the metal used

239
00:14:37,942 --> 00:14:39,942
or maybe the maintenance on it

240
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,982
anything that would cause
the gear to fail in any way

241
00:14:43,823 --> 00:14:47,342
and if it was a design problem
that's a big deal

242
00:14:47,501 --> 00:14:49,701
the landing gear
failing on impact

243
00:14:49,743 --> 00:14:51,743
would explain
this tragic accident

244
00:14:52,464 --> 00:14:54,546
did we get this piece
of landing gear yet?

245
00:14:59,222 --> 00:15:00,222
not yet

246
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:07,209
the landing gear collapsed

247
00:15:08,302 --> 00:15:11,362
that was perhaps the most important
question that we had to deal with

248
00:15:16,748 --> 00:15:21,462
while investigators wait for the
right landing gear of flight 495

249
00:15:22,102 --> 00:15:25,043
they considered what could
have caused it to fracture

250
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,491
maybe the plane was too heavy

251
00:15:28,622 --> 00:15:30,322
if the aircraft were over weight

252
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,325
and made a very firm touch down

253
00:15:32,821 --> 00:15:37,821
then the loads imparted could exceed the
design limit causing it to break and shear

254
00:15:41,503 --> 00:15:43,503
let's check the load manifest

255
00:15:49,944 --> 00:15:52,903
the plane and a cargo
were roughly 218,000 pounds

256
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,200
it was 340 people on board

257
00:15:57,181 --> 00:15:58,781
let's call it 53,000 pounds

258
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:02,666
and fuel

259
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,220
fuel was

260
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,660
20,000 pounds

261
00:16:11,706 --> 00:16:14,229
so total weight on landing
was 353,000 pounds

262
00:16:14,787 --> 00:16:15,787
give or take

263
00:16:17,822 --> 00:16:22,022
max weight is 424,000 pounds

264
00:16:28,382 --> 00:16:29,382
so

265
00:16:29,782 --> 00:16:30,782
these guys

266
00:16:31,342 --> 00:16:33,583
were 70,000 pounds underweight

267
00:16:34,178 --> 00:16:35,178
it wasn't too heavy

268
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:41,123
the weight of the plane is not what
cause the landing gear to fail on touchdown

269
00:16:43,459 --> 00:16:45,259
how about weight distribution?

270
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:51,700
you have to have the baggage
and the weight distributed properly

271
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:55,142
so the aircraft will fly the
way the pilots wanted to

272
00:16:57,223 --> 00:16:58,223
by the book

273
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,100
it was properly loaded
properly stored

274
00:17:03,101 --> 00:17:04,201
properly locked down

275
00:17:04,282 --> 00:17:06,282
so it wasn't really an issue

276
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,047
with weight and balance ruled out

277
00:17:11,343 --> 00:17:14,964
investigators are finally able to
test the right landing gear itself

278
00:17:16,986 --> 00:17:18,986
service records are up to date

279
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,480
let's see if this steel
wasn't strong enough

280
00:17:24,184 --> 00:17:26,184
another thing they
were looking for

281
00:17:26,744 --> 00:17:29,244
is any preexistence
weaknesses on the steel

282
00:17:30,701 --> 00:17:33,701
if this occurred in the
manufacturing process

283
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,380
it could affect the aircraft in
operations all around the world

284
00:17:39,103 --> 00:17:42,105
they performed something
called a Vickers hardness test

285
00:17:42,178 --> 00:17:45,578
Vickers hardness test is
an industry standard test

286
00:17:45,582 --> 00:17:50,382
to evaluate the strength of a
particular component or piece of metal

287
00:17:51,225 --> 00:17:54,251
a pyramid shaped diamond
is presses into the steel

288
00:17:54,619 --> 00:17:56,619
leaving an indent or dimple

289
00:17:57,461 --> 00:18:01,461
you can measure the depth
and the diameter of the dimple

290
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:04,905
and drive the metallurgical
strength of what you're testing

291
00:18:05,942 --> 00:18:07,442
hardness value 658

292
00:18:08,223 --> 00:18:10,223
so the steal was strong enough

293
00:18:11,905 --> 00:18:16,460
investigators find no weakness in metal
used to make the plane's landing gear

294
00:18:16,981 --> 00:18:20,543
it was determined there was
nothing wrong with the landing gear

295
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,740
whatever went wrong

296
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,560
it happened before the
airplane touch the runway

297
00:18:27,704 --> 00:18:31,781
there are still no clues that's gonna help
explain why the landing gear fractured

298
00:18:32,782 --> 00:18:37,484
the next step in the investigation was
to look at how the crew was operating

299
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:40,084
during the last
phase of the landing

300
00:18:50,386 --> 00:18:51,386
this is interesting

301
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:54,499
official statements
made by the pilots

302
00:18:54,561 --> 00:18:58,082
may shed some lights on the
final moments of Martin-air Flight 495

303
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:02,861
after the accident the
investigators came to all three of us

304
00:19:03,582 --> 00:19:05,582
we had close sessions

305
00:19:07,785 --> 00:19:09,785
the captain said
the flight was normal

306
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,340
the approach was normal

307
00:19:12,341 --> 00:19:14,341
at 200 feet
we were on the center line

308
00:19:15,698 --> 00:19:17,198
they should have been okay

309
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,260
but a few seconds later

310
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:21,701
the captain sees lightening

311
00:19:21,704 --> 00:19:23,704
I suddenly felt a high sink rate

312
00:19:23,859 --> 00:19:25,559
it all happened so fast

313
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,580
the aircraft actually
fell out of the sky

314
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,760
according to the captain

315
00:19:30,901 --> 00:19:34,604
he saw lightening just seconds
before the aircraft began to lose altitude

316
00:19:35,144 --> 00:19:36,144
rapidly

317
00:19:37,386 --> 00:19:38,386
sink rate

318
00:19:40,349 --> 00:19:42,249
the airplane fell like
god toke his hands

319
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,900
rounded into the ground

320
00:19:45,181 --> 00:19:46,181
well
get this

321
00:19:46,342 --> 00:19:47,942
the first officer state is

322
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:50,519
the weather was bad
and it was raining heavily

323
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,540
it was gusty and very turbulent

324
00:19:53,343 --> 00:19:55,843
investigators wonder
if sudden wind changes

325
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:59,296
could have been contributed
to the crash of flight 495

326
00:19:59,861 --> 00:20:02,561
the flight crew indicated
to the investigators

327
00:20:02,663 --> 00:20:06,704
that they were in an
area of a lot of wind shear

328
00:20:07,547 --> 00:20:09,547
a very dynamic weather condition

329
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,060
they were in turbulence

330
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,780
things were
changing very rapidly

331
00:20:14,622 --> 00:20:18,058
did the pilot encounter
wind shear on final approach?

332
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:22,761
the team interviews
the air traffic controller

333
00:20:22,828 --> 00:20:25,848
to better understand the conditions
the pilots were experiencing

334
00:20:27,063 --> 00:20:29,123
can you tell me what
happened with flight 495?

335
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,100
everything seemed
perfectly normal

336
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,660
they were on
their final approach

337
00:20:35,183 --> 00:20:37,183
and confirmed they
had a runway insight

338
00:20:37,754 --> 00:20:39,254
then I clear them to land

339
00:20:41,661 --> 00:20:42,661
Martin-air Flight 495

340
00:20:43,663 --> 00:20:45,343
clear to land
runway 11

341
00:20:45,664 --> 00:20:46,664
the wind
150

342
00:20:47,659 --> 00:20:49,759
15 knots
max 20

343
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:54,042
the controls were quite confident
that they performed well the task

344
00:20:54,703 --> 00:20:57,299
so they didn't find that
they did anything wrong

345
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,820
and they gave the
correct information

346
00:21:00,101 --> 00:21:03,124
did they report any
issues with the plane?

347
00:21:04,064 --> 00:21:05,064
no not at all

348
00:21:06,347 --> 00:21:07,347
what about the weather?

349
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,463
there was rain
but

350
00:21:12,542 --> 00:21:15,806
other planes were taking off
and landing without difficulty

351
00:21:17,305 --> 00:21:19,405
Martin-air Flight 461
runway visual

352
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,700
just minutes before the crash

353
00:21:22,701 --> 00:21:25,701
the controller was in contact
with an aircraft that took off

354
00:21:25,783 --> 00:21:27,899
and another that landed
on the same runway

355
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,060
clear to land runway 11

356
00:21:32,303 --> 00:21:35,084
neither flight reported extreme
weather over the runway

357
00:21:37,621 --> 00:21:38,621
what about wind shear?

358
00:21:39,622 --> 00:21:41,622
did the runway sensors
pick up anything?

359
00:21:44,699 --> 00:21:47,440
faro airport is equipped
with two anemometers

360
00:21:47,821 --> 00:21:49,843
that measure both
wind speed and direction

361
00:21:50,383 --> 00:21:52,083
located on runway 29

362
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,860
and runway 11

363
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:59,283
if the anemometers detect a sudden
change in wind speed of 50 knots or greater

364
00:21:59,344 --> 00:22:01,846
a wind shear warning
is automatically triggered

365
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,380
yes, they were
wind shear warnings

366
00:22:13,463 --> 00:22:16,242
but they happened after the
aircraft had already crashed

367
00:22:22,742 --> 00:22:27,538
if flight 495 was hit by an extreme gust
of wind before it crashed to the runway

368
00:22:28,379 --> 00:22:30,379
the system would
have detected it

369
00:22:30,942 --> 00:22:31,942
it didn't

370
00:22:33,264 --> 00:22:36,864
there was a conflicting information
between what the crew said

371
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:39,806
and what the air
traffic controller reports

372
00:22:40,622 --> 00:22:43,985
the crew statements don't match
the controllers account of the weather

373
00:22:45,987 --> 00:22:46,987
thank you

374
00:22:49,941 --> 00:22:52,541
the best thing to substantiate
what went on

375
00:22:53,022 --> 00:22:55,222
was to take a really
deep look at what the

376
00:22:55,265 --> 00:22:58,273
pilots were saying to
each other in the cockpit

377
00:23:01,701 --> 00:23:03,701
let's start with
their approach brief

378
00:23:05,103 --> 00:23:07,103
a week after the
crash of flight 495

379
00:23:07,665 --> 00:23:11,200
data from the cockpit voice
recorder is ready to be reviewed

380
00:23:12,461 --> 00:23:13,461
approach at 50 flaps

381
00:23:14,984 --> 00:23:17,284
you can't approach in
minimum and field in sight

382
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,820
you look outside

383
00:23:19,542 --> 00:23:20,542
wet runway

384
00:23:21,943 --> 00:23:22,943
here the wipers

385
00:23:23,384 --> 00:23:24,384
roger

386
00:23:25,139 --> 00:23:27,339
as the crew prepares
for the approach

387
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:30,522
they become aware of
weather conditions at faro airport

388
00:23:31,903 --> 00:23:33,903
we have to make
a positive landing

389
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:35,179
yes

390
00:23:36,983 --> 00:23:37,983
okay

391
00:23:38,502 --> 00:23:39,502
so

392
00:23:39,624 --> 00:23:42,264
obviously they worried
about the runway conditions

393
00:23:44,707 --> 00:23:45,707
in a positive landing

394
00:23:46,138 --> 00:23:49,661
the aircraft touches down firmly
enough to penetrate the water

395
00:23:49,821 --> 00:23:53,398
allowing the wheels to grip
the tarmac and slow the airplane

396
00:23:55,421 --> 00:23:59,322
they wanna put it down hard to avoid
hydroplaning and running out of the runway

397
00:23:59,663 --> 00:24:01,183
so what went wrong?

398
00:24:01,664 --> 00:24:05,180
did the pilots somehow botch their
plan as they approach the runway?

399
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,100
500
clear

400
00:24:13,221 --> 00:24:14,661
speed is a bit low

401
00:24:15,624 --> 00:24:16,624
speed is low

402
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:19,859
low

403
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:21,541
okay

404
00:24:22,501 --> 00:24:24,501
now speed is an issue

405
00:24:25,578 --> 00:24:27,178
going on to a wet runway

406
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,580
the airspeed control
is very very important

407
00:24:29,861 --> 00:24:32,443
so if you don't have too much
the airplane floats

408
00:24:32,667 --> 00:24:36,067
but if you don't have too little
you end up impacting the runway quite hard

409
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,420
now
let's hear more

410
00:24:39,983 --> 00:24:41,023
speed is okay

411
00:24:41,544 --> 00:24:44,044
wind shield went into ice
I can't see anything

412
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:45,125
I'm on it

413
00:24:45,266 --> 00:24:46,466
wipers run fast

414
00:24:47,283 --> 00:24:49,340
as the plane gets
closer to the ground

415
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,461
the crew contends
with stormy conditions

416
00:24:53,464 --> 00:24:54,464
a bit low

417
00:24:55,584 --> 00:24:56,584
low

418
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,420
yes

419
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,020
throttles

420
00:25:10,661 --> 00:25:13,102
why does the captain
yelled throttles?

421
00:25:15,141 --> 00:25:17,641
for the captain to say this
at this moment

422
00:25:17,705 --> 00:25:19,305
it raises the question

423
00:25:19,383 --> 00:25:22,422
did they have an issue in
the final phase of landing?

424
00:25:23,306 --> 00:25:25,306
let's look at the descent profile

425
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:28,891
if flight 495 flawing
on the right trajectory

426
00:25:28,948 --> 00:25:29,948
the FDR will confirm it

427
00:25:31,022 --> 00:25:32,022
here we are

428
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,200
the flight data recorder

429
00:25:34,543 --> 00:25:38,605
gives objective clear data on
what the airplane was actually doing

430
00:25:39,906 --> 00:25:42,439
was the airplane being
flown at the proper speed

431
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,140
the changes in the airspeed

432
00:25:45,822 --> 00:25:48,880
were they indicative of a
severe weather condition?

433
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:52,742
and how were the pilots
responding to those changes

434
00:25:54,459 --> 00:25:55,459
auto pilot is on

435
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:56,900
okay
so

436
00:25:56,921 --> 00:25:59,062
they're descending
at the standard angle

437
00:25:59,864 --> 00:26:00,864
and

438
00:26:00,905 --> 00:26:02,505
they dipped here and recover

439
00:26:05,139 --> 00:26:06,139
looks fine

440
00:26:08,543 --> 00:26:11,600
at 200 feet which is about
20 seconds from landing

441
00:26:11,939 --> 00:26:13,539
they were on a normal glide path

442
00:26:15,899 --> 00:26:17,899
something happened between

443
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:20,140
that and touchdown

444
00:26:21,543 --> 00:26:23,543
let's look at the airspeed data

445
00:26:25,867 --> 00:26:26,867
so

446
00:26:26,946 --> 00:26:29,980
looks like they're flying
steady at a 145 knots

447
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,300
until here

448
00:26:31,862 --> 00:26:33,362
and airspeed jumps

449
00:26:34,703 --> 00:26:36,704
and then drops all
the way to a 139 knots

450
00:26:39,506 --> 00:26:42,040
investigators spot evidence
of airspeed fluctuations

451
00:26:42,581 --> 00:26:44,581
during the last
minute of the flight

452
00:26:45,702 --> 00:26:47,402
these fluctuations in airspeed

453
00:26:48,099 --> 00:26:49,699
can be caused by wind gusts

454
00:26:50,502 --> 00:26:52,502
as they got closer to landing

455
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,900
speed is a bit low

456
00:27:02,582 --> 00:27:03,582
speed is low

457
00:27:10,743 --> 00:27:11,783
speed is okay

458
00:27:12,743 --> 00:27:15,343
was the captain concern
their speed wasn't fast enough

459
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:17,445
to compensate for
the strong headwind

460
00:27:22,022 --> 00:27:25,622
these fluctuations seem to extremely
be caused by the 20 knots winds

461
00:27:25,705 --> 00:27:27,338
reported by the controller

462
00:27:27,426 --> 00:27:30,479
we need a full analysis of the
weather conditions on final approach

463
00:27:34,742 --> 00:27:37,524
investigators ask the
Netherlands aerospace laboratory

464
00:27:37,825 --> 00:27:39,825
to perform an
in depth weather study

465
00:27:40,098 --> 00:27:42,740
to determine if the winds were
stronger than what was reported

466
00:27:42,941 --> 00:27:43,981
to flight 495

467
00:27:44,943 --> 00:27:46,943
what about auto throttle data

468
00:27:47,784 --> 00:27:48,784
let's take a look

469
00:27:54,543 --> 00:27:57,643
the fluctuations
and the auto throttle

470
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:01,360
correspond to the
airspeed fluctuations

471
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,820
if there is an
increase in airspeed

472
00:28:07,901 --> 00:28:12,201
the auto throttle system will decrease
the power that is being commanded

473
00:28:12,386 --> 00:28:14,427
the amount of thrust that
the engines are producing

474
00:28:16,059 --> 00:28:17,759
if the airspeed falls low

475
00:28:18,622 --> 00:28:21,663
the auto throttle system
will command increase thrust

476
00:28:22,024 --> 00:28:25,059
to bring the airplane up to
the commanded airspeed

477
00:28:27,101 --> 00:28:31,163
the auto throttles were indeed adjusting
for the dramatic changes in airspeed

478
00:28:31,684 --> 00:28:32,684
well

479
00:28:32,778 --> 00:28:33,778
look at that

480
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,180
102% power

481
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:39,424
investigators discover a very
high surge in engine power

482
00:28:39,865 --> 00:28:42,040
3 quarters of a mile from
the runway threshold

483
00:28:42,942 --> 00:28:46,002
the 102 percent command
by the auto throttle system

484
00:28:46,064 --> 00:28:48,064
is a massive amount of power

485
00:28:48,067 --> 00:28:51,539
it would be similar to the amount of
power that you would use for take off

486
00:28:52,302 --> 00:28:54,002
too much power try to land with

487
00:28:55,144 --> 00:28:56,144
and then here

488
00:28:56,304 --> 00:28:57,304
power drops to 40%

489
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:02,322
the team discovers that the
power drops to a minimum

490
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:03,541
or engine idle

491
00:29:03,982 --> 00:29:04,982
shortly thereafter

492
00:29:06,262 --> 00:29:09,782
that's way too fast for the auto
throttle system to perform on its own

493
00:29:13,581 --> 00:29:16,067
for the engines to decelerate
as quickly as they did

494
00:29:16,702 --> 00:29:20,502
means that the levers were
moved faster than auto throttle

495
00:29:20,623 --> 00:29:22,623
clutches can
physically move them

496
00:29:23,145 --> 00:29:26,006
the only way the throttles
were moved that quick

497
00:29:26,542 --> 00:29:28,642
would be if the
pilots was manually

498
00:29:28,783 --> 00:29:30,516
adjusting them down to 40%

499
00:29:32,464 --> 00:29:35,064
the auto throttle system
could make large corrections

500
00:29:35,307 --> 00:29:38,807
and you have to make manual adjustments
if the throttle aren't keeping up

501
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:47,404
the first officer who
was the flying pilot

502
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:50,347
made a decision to override
the auto throttle system

503
00:29:51,068 --> 00:29:53,104
and to pull the power way back

504
00:29:55,821 --> 00:29:58,364
and in fact he pulled it all
the way back to flight idle

505
00:29:59,462 --> 00:30:00,462
with so little power

506
00:30:00,859 --> 00:30:02,859
they would have
dropped like a rock

507
00:30:03,381 --> 00:30:04,381
according to the data

508
00:30:05,101 --> 00:30:07,101
they would drop in a
thousand feet per minute

509
00:30:09,064 --> 00:30:10,764
one thousand feet is well beyond

510
00:30:10,785 --> 00:30:14,661
the operational limit of 600
feet per minute for the DC-10

511
00:30:15,261 --> 00:30:17,461
as a consequence
of the reduce power

512
00:30:17,824 --> 00:30:20,845
the plane hit the runway with
enough force to crack the landing gear

513
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:26,802
I've never experience
a landing as hard as that

514
00:30:27,702 --> 00:30:29,702
I crushed my teeth and my mouth

515
00:30:31,939 --> 00:30:33,939
it was hard beyond compare

516
00:30:34,501 --> 00:30:37,624
investigators are left
with the key question

517
00:30:38,465 --> 00:30:41,039
why would the crew
reduce power by so much?

518
00:30:41,861 --> 00:30:44,261
so far from the runway threshold

519
00:30:53,945 --> 00:30:55,945
this is the dutch weather record

520
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,220
investigators turn
to a weather analysis

521
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,002
prepared by the Netherlands
aerospace laboratory

522
00:31:01,342 --> 00:31:03,845
to determine if the weather
affected the crew's actions

523
00:31:04,185 --> 00:31:05,785
during their final approach

524
00:31:06,466 --> 00:31:09,561
looks like the weather was
worse than what they thought

525
00:31:09,579 --> 00:31:10,579
really

526
00:31:11,022 --> 00:31:13,502
they had no less than
3 separate micro-bursts

527
00:31:13,544 --> 00:31:15,744
in the last minute of flight

528
00:31:15,825 --> 00:31:16,825
wow
okay

529
00:31:19,227 --> 00:31:22,867
a micro-burst is a column of air
that descends from rain clouds

530
00:31:23,459 --> 00:31:24,459
hits the ground

531
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,900
and fans out horizontally

532
00:31:26,901 --> 00:31:29,901
it leads to significant
fluctuations in a plane's airspeed

533
00:31:35,621 --> 00:31:36,621
when exactly?

534
00:31:40,145 --> 00:31:42,145
the first one was it 700 feet

535
00:31:44,901 --> 00:31:47,901
the second was
between 600 and 300 feet

536
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:55,662
and the last one was
between 200 and 110 feet

537
00:32:02,019 --> 00:32:03,519
this last one was the worst

538
00:32:05,141 --> 00:32:09,305
the wind speed jumped from
the reported 20 knots to 40 knots

539
00:32:10,226 --> 00:32:11,226
wow

540
00:32:11,619 --> 00:32:13,819
that would have triggered
a wind shear alert if

541
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,860
one was installed on the plane

542
00:32:16,422 --> 00:32:18,963
then wind shifts from a
head-wind to a tail-wind

543
00:32:23,461 --> 00:32:25,761
a sudden shift from
head-wind to tail-wind

544
00:32:26,022 --> 00:32:28,022
is the worse type of
wind-shear because

545
00:32:28,299 --> 00:32:30,341
a head-wind improves
your angle of attack

546
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:32,698
to ensure that
aircraft has good lift

547
00:32:34,381 --> 00:32:36,881
when the wind switches
around to a tail-wind

548
00:32:37,464 --> 00:32:39,464
you lose that
aerodynamic performance

549
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:44,499
if you don't have the thrust
to compensate for, right away

550
00:32:44,781 --> 00:32:45,781
the aircraft will drop

551
00:32:48,462 --> 00:32:51,545
let's compare this to
the auto throttle data

552
00:33:00,781 --> 00:33:01,821
they lined up

553
00:33:03,623 --> 00:33:04,623
for every micro-burst

554
00:33:05,145 --> 00:33:07,345
there's a corresponding
increase in engine power

555
00:33:07,701 --> 00:33:11,214
as the auto throttles try to
maintain the plane's speed

556
00:33:11,619 --> 00:33:14,220
the auto throttle was
going up and down

557
00:33:14,741 --> 00:33:18,483
it was trying very hard to fight
against those heavy down-bursts

558
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:24,059
the down-burst causes
a decrease in stability

559
00:33:25,143 --> 00:33:28,145
which means turbulence
induce roll and pitch oscillations

560
00:33:32,422 --> 00:33:34,222
would have been a bumpy ride

561
00:33:34,242 --> 00:33:35,242
yeah

562
00:33:35,944 --> 00:33:37,944
as they pass through
each micro-burst

563
00:33:38,506 --> 00:33:41,578
the auto-throttles were
adjusting to the shifts in wind gusts

564
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:55,780
in the final moments

565
00:33:56,261 --> 00:33:59,361
the approach was under
extreme weather conditions

566
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:01,904
there were a lot of
oscillations in speed

567
00:34:02,185 --> 00:34:05,340
and that create a lot of stress
for the pilot flying at that time

568
00:34:07,221 --> 00:34:11,021
the first officer likely would
have been overwhelmed

569
00:34:11,184 --> 00:34:13,851
by the unexpected
changes in the weather

570
00:34:17,059 --> 00:34:21,142
and knowing that he needed to make a
positive landing at the runway threshold

571
00:34:21,584 --> 00:34:23,880
he sees the power
spike to a 102%

572
00:34:25,261 --> 00:34:26,861
and takes a corrective action

573
00:34:27,541 --> 00:34:29,583
in order to get the
plane on the ground

574
00:34:29,823 --> 00:34:33,840
the first officer overrides the auto
throttle and reduces the power to idle

575
00:34:36,582 --> 00:34:39,644
investigators now see just
how unfortunate his timing was

576
00:34:41,908 --> 00:34:45,600
he cut the power at the exact same
time that last down-burst hit them

577
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,900
throttles

578
00:34:54,021 --> 00:34:57,063
the captain tries to stop
the plane's uncontrolled descent

579
00:34:59,384 --> 00:35:00,384
but he's too late

580
00:35:08,026 --> 00:35:09,639
the captain should
have stepped in sooner

581
00:35:12,262 --> 00:35:14,842
it should have recognize
something was not right

582
00:35:16,779 --> 00:35:19,582
the captain really should have
taken over and landed himself

583
00:35:22,144 --> 00:35:24,824
investigators suspect to the
sudden change in weather

584
00:35:25,545 --> 00:35:28,280
combined with the pilot's
decision to cut the power too early

585
00:35:28,621 --> 00:35:32,142
caused the aircraft to land with more
force than it was build to withstand

586
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,600
but one question
remains unanswered

587
00:35:37,382 --> 00:35:38,782
if the winds were gusting

588
00:35:39,384 --> 00:35:40,384
at 40 knots

589
00:35:40,825 --> 00:35:42,725
half mile from the runway

590
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:48,743
wouldn't the winds at the runway be
gusting stronger than the 20 knots reported

591
00:35:48,743 --> 00:35:49,743
by the controller

592
00:35:59,926 --> 00:36:03,326
the team returns with their
findings to the air traffic controller

593
00:36:03,346 --> 00:36:05,346
who oversaw
Martin-air Flight 495

594
00:36:07,302 --> 00:36:10,302
you reported that the
winds on runway 11

595
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,200
were gusting up to 20 knots

596
00:36:14,001 --> 00:36:15,001
that's correct

597
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,423
but that doesn't seem right

598
00:36:17,705 --> 00:36:21,205
the dutch weather study confirmed
that there were 3 micro-burst

599
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,040
in the last minute of flight

600
00:36:23,122 --> 00:36:25,122
with gust much higher than that

601
00:36:28,458 --> 00:36:32,121
can you show me the
actual data from runway 11?

602
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:47,621
according to the raw data

603
00:36:49,464 --> 00:36:51,860
the winds were actually
gusting at 35 knots

604
00:36:54,262 --> 00:36:55,262
that sounds more like it

605
00:36:57,103 --> 00:36:58,103
but

606
00:36:58,264 --> 00:37:01,360
how could you have
under-reported the wind conditions?

607
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:14,601
we receive wind data every
30 seconds from this device

608
00:37:20,662 --> 00:37:22,683
it must have been
switched to runway 29

609
00:37:28,261 --> 00:37:29,561
instead of runway 11

610
00:37:33,583 --> 00:37:37,583
investigators discover the the
air traffic controllers at Faro airport

611
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:40,739
had mistakenly selected the
wind reading on runway 29

612
00:37:41,379 --> 00:37:42,879
instead of runway 11

613
00:37:46,184 --> 00:37:47,784
airports are large places

614
00:37:47,859 --> 00:37:50,802
that when you have anemometers
one opposite into the airport

615
00:37:50,981 --> 00:37:53,559
you would expect that frequently
there would be a difference

616
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:56,801
in direction and velocity
of the reported wind

617
00:37:57,742 --> 00:38:00,242
Martin-air 495
clear to land runway 11

618
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:05,122
the wind 150
15 knots maximum 20

619
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:11,579
clear to land

620
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:15,900
the controllers information
that they provided to the crew

621
00:38:15,902 --> 00:38:19,465
was not representative of what
was actually occurring on the runway

622
00:38:27,143 --> 00:38:28,643
wet runway
cross winds

623
00:38:29,665 --> 00:38:31,485
that's completely
different picture

624
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:33,727
if the pilots were aware

625
00:38:34,019 --> 00:38:35,519
they would have go around

626
00:38:37,382 --> 00:38:40,905
investigators have figured out
what brought down flight 495

627
00:38:48,343 --> 00:38:49,843
495 is turning in-bound

628
00:38:52,219 --> 00:38:53,219
495
copy

629
00:38:53,661 --> 00:38:55,521
report at minimum
so on runway insight

630
00:38:56,142 --> 00:38:58,142
runway surface
conditions are flood

631
00:38:58,984 --> 00:38:59,984
roger 495

632
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,420
gear down

633
00:39:09,622 --> 00:39:10,622
gear down

634
00:39:10,904 --> 00:39:12,904
with the runway at Faro 
underwater

635
00:39:13,466 --> 00:39:17,008
the crew plans a positive
touch-down at the runway threshold

636
00:39:17,699 --> 00:39:18,699
clear to land
runway 11

637
00:39:19,701 --> 00:39:23,301
the wind 150
15 knots maximum 20

638
00:39:25,345 --> 00:39:28,425
but they're unaware of the
severity of the weather conditions

639
00:39:29,018 --> 00:39:31,018
I can't see anything
I'm on it

640
00:39:33,261 --> 00:39:35,682
they hit by a serious of
unexpected micro-bursts

641
00:39:38,346 --> 00:39:41,366
causing the engine power
to shoot up automatically

642
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:46,482
concerned that the excess power
is too great for a positive landing

643
00:39:48,184 --> 00:39:53,059
the first officer reduces the power to
idle just as the last micro-burst occurs

644
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,862
that makes them
vulnerable to strong winds

645
00:39:56,621 --> 00:39:58,621
and the aircraft
dropped from 155

646
00:40:07,301 --> 00:40:10,821
flight 495 slams to the ground
at the 1000 feet per minute

647
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:23,307
the danger of being slow and
encountering a down-draft is

648
00:40:23,619 --> 00:40:27,419
you may not be
able to recover in time

649
00:40:27,419 --> 00:40:29,120
and that can be a disastrous

650
00:40:31,099 --> 00:40:33,100
they could have come
with the high speed

651
00:40:33,381 --> 00:40:35,503
they could have performed
a missed approach

652
00:40:35,944 --> 00:40:38,624
but the truth is the
flight crew try their best

653
00:40:39,906 --> 00:40:43,600
this wasn't an accident
where we can see negligence

654
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:45,141
or cross-error

655
00:40:48,103 --> 00:40:52,359
in the aftermath of their report
into the crash of Martin-air Flight 495

656
00:40:52,901 --> 00:40:55,179
investigators make a
serious of recommendations

657
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:01,600
this accident was going to
be yet another example of

658
00:41:01,828 --> 00:41:04,019
inappropriate
wind shear recovery

659
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,781
being applied in
a timely fashion

660
00:41:07,342 --> 00:41:09,942
so this is additional
pilot training

661
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:14,440
this is wind shear detection
systems on airplanes

662
00:41:15,543 --> 00:41:20,902
this is a more aggressive approach
to go around in unstable conditions

663
00:41:21,742 --> 00:41:22,742
shortly after the crash

664
00:41:23,183 --> 00:41:26,741
Faro airport modernize their
wind senses and displays

665
00:41:27,087 --> 00:41:29,987
to comply with
international regulations

666
00:41:30,741 --> 00:41:34,841
the critical information that
controllers provide to pilots

667
00:41:34,941 --> 00:41:35,941
needs to be accurate

668
00:41:37,222 --> 00:41:40,899
so these are some of the lessons that
the industry learned and implemented

669
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:42,980
following this accident

670
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:49,280
you know one of the things I was
told when I was coming a pilot is

671
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,320
never let your guard down

672
00:41:51,302 --> 00:41:53,879
you can be having a
beautiful wonderful flight

673
00:41:54,379 --> 00:41:58,622
and in the blink of eye
the things can change

674
00:41:58,622 --> 00:42:01,422
it's just ingrained in my mind

675
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:03,460
always be ready
for the unexpected
