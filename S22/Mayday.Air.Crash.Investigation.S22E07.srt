1
00:00:01,943 --> 00:00:03,943
on approach during
a thunderstorm

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,980
both runway is wet
severe turbulence

3
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:11,901
American airlines flight
1572 loses a valuable lifeline

4
00:00:12,581 --> 00:00:14,381
be advised
the tower is closed

5
00:00:14,502 --> 00:00:16,622
there is a leaky
window in the tower

6
00:00:17,624 --> 00:00:20,761
the tower had actually been
abandoned, this is a very unusual situation

7
00:00:21,302 --> 00:00:25,265
NTSB investigators learned that a
supervisor went to the deserted tower

8
00:00:26,338 --> 00:00:27,780
I told them they could land

9
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,040
landing is at your discretion

10
00:00:30,064 --> 00:00:31,564
the runway does
appear to be clear

11
00:00:31,622 --> 00:00:33,122
moments before touchdown

12
00:00:34,184 --> 00:00:35,184
disaster strikes

13
00:00:35,298 --> 00:00:36,298
what's up?

14
00:00:36,459 --> 00:00:38,459
and both of the
plane's engines failed

15
00:00:39,308 --> 00:00:41,108
what role did an
out of service tower

16
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,692
play in jeopardizing the
lives of 78 people on board?

17
00:00:45,502 --> 00:00:47,002
tell them we're going down

18
00:01:12,588 --> 00:01:14,588
on a stormy November night

19
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,160
American airlines flight 1572

20
00:01:17,862 --> 00:01:20,718
cruises 35,000 feet
above Pennsylvania

21
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:26,002
smother ride up here
rather than 33,000

22
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,750
Captain Kenneth Lee

23
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:33,223
a former military pilot has been
flying with American airlines for 10 years

24
00:01:34,623 --> 00:01:35,623
that's for sure

25
00:01:36,622 --> 00:01:39,745
First Officer John Richards
also flew with the military

26
00:01:40,305 --> 00:01:42,708
and has 7 years of
commercial aviation experience

27
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,320
this was a very
experienced flight crew

28
00:01:47,502 --> 00:01:50,769
that was very comfortable
with the aircraft they were flying

29
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:53,744
they're flying the MD-83

30
00:01:53,938 --> 00:01:55,938
a twin engine narrow body jet

31
00:01:57,421 --> 00:02:00,402
it has two turbo fan
engines mounted in a tail

32
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,201
as a t-tail and a
swept main wing

33
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:06,941
it was one of the last
aircraft that actually had

34
00:02:06,944 --> 00:02:08,899
direct connection between

35
00:02:08,904 --> 00:02:12,680
the controls in the cockpit
and the surfaces on the airplane

36
00:02:13,422 --> 00:02:15,622
better get the cabin
ready for our descent

37
00:02:19,899 --> 00:02:20,899
hi

38
00:02:21,382 --> 00:02:24,742
we're starting our descent now so you can
luck the cabin up and prepare for landing

39
00:02:24,803 --> 00:02:25,803
we'll do

40
00:02:30,981 --> 00:02:32,581
please fasten your seat belt

41
00:02:34,101 --> 00:02:37,222
it's short two hour flight
from Chicago O'Hare airport

42
00:02:38,062 --> 00:02:42,105
to Bradley International Airport
at Windsor locks Connecticut

43
00:02:42,545 --> 00:02:45,640
they are 5 crew and
73 passengers on board

44
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,880
many of them returning home

45
00:02:48,462 --> 00:02:50,483
please put your seat
in the upward position

46
00:02:54,902 --> 00:02:57,000
flight started out
the rather routinely

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,898
it was the second day of a
three day leg trip for these guys

48
00:03:00,941 --> 00:03:02,541
American 1572

49
00:03:02,822 --> 00:03:06,704
descend that pilot discretion
maintain flight level 190

50
00:03:07,619 --> 00:03:10,641
pilots , discretion to
190, American 1572

51
00:03:12,418 --> 00:03:13,958
let's go down

52
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,258
the flight is 25
minutes from landing

53
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,800
I'm gonna get the
ATIS real quick

54
00:03:22,063 --> 00:03:24,363
Bradley Airport information
vector 03

55
00:03:25,366 --> 00:03:28,266
ATIS or Automatic
Terminal Information Service

56
00:03:28,306 --> 00:03:33,105
provides pilots with important airport
data like weather and approaches

57
00:03:33,944 --> 00:03:36,458
notice to airman
runway 25 and 15

58
00:03:38,424 --> 00:03:40,523
both runway is wet
severe turbulence

59
00:03:41,224 --> 00:03:42,224
all right

60
00:03:42,664 --> 00:03:44,205
sounds it's gonna
be a bumpy ride

61
00:03:44,947 --> 00:03:45,947
tell the passengers

62
00:03:46,669 --> 00:03:49,519
they'll encounter some
rough weather along the way

63
00:03:49,742 --> 00:03:52,304
but nothing these experienced
crew can't managed

64
00:03:53,706 --> 00:03:57,406
many times I have experienced
the same kinds of winds and weather

65
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,580
and these crew has had

66
00:03:58,742 --> 00:04:02,350
and winds will have a drastic effect
on the airplane and pushing it around

67
00:04:02,504 --> 00:04:04,204
the crew was very
familiar with the weather

68
00:04:04,219 --> 00:04:07,931
and they were highly experienced
enough to handle anything

69
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:09,561
we've started our descent

70
00:04:09,663 --> 00:04:13,018
right now they've reported some
moderate turbulence on the descent

71
00:04:13,338 --> 00:04:15,038
so make it a little choppy

72
00:04:18,704 --> 00:04:20,304
just watch me the whole way

73
00:04:20,424 --> 00:04:21,724
yeah man, you got it

74
00:04:22,148 --> 00:04:24,221
the pilots prepare
for the landing

75
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,321
any comments
just scream out

76
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,120
you gotta get a
lot of turbulence

77
00:04:30,581 --> 00:04:32,181
you know how to  land it

78
00:04:33,142 --> 00:04:35,423
they support each other
they back each other up

79
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,820
if anything goes wrong or
somebody does something wrong

80
00:04:39,061 --> 00:04:41,062
the other one catches
it and corrects it

81
00:04:42,423 --> 00:04:44,223
50 miles from the airport

82
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:45,819
the weather worsens

83
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,402
it's a lot of rain
I can see that

84
00:04:52,307 --> 00:04:54,189
the in route controllers
had told them

85
00:04:54,209 --> 00:04:57,485
the weather is really bad due
the thunderstorm and wind shear

86
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,842
wind shear is a sudden
change of wind speed or direction

87
00:05:02,184 --> 00:05:04,285
that can be dangerous
close to the ground

88
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,880
American 1572

89
00:05:08,101 --> 00:05:09,801
descend and maintain 4000

90
00:05:11,219 --> 00:05:12,719
descending 4000
1572

91
00:05:14,901 --> 00:05:18,999
flight 1572 is the last plane
flying into Bradley Airport tonight

92
00:05:21,662 --> 00:05:22,662
approach to 4000

93
00:05:24,743 --> 00:05:27,988
the crew is making a difficult
non-precision approach

94
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,121
a non-precision approach means
you don't have a navigation aid

95
00:05:34,264 --> 00:05:37,040
there's more reliance on the
crew to figure out the altitude

96
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,700
and descends those
altitude correctly

97
00:05:38,822 --> 00:05:40,902
and avoid all the
terrain that's below there

98
00:05:42,504 --> 00:05:46,546
we're established on the in
bound track for the VOR Approach

99
00:05:47,299 --> 00:05:48,299
flaps 5

100
00:05:51,382 --> 00:05:52,382
flaps 5

101
00:05:52,663 --> 00:05:56,760
this type of approach
creates extra work for the pilots

102
00:05:56,899 --> 00:06:00,160
the not precision approach is the
hardest of all the approaches to fly

103
00:06:00,301 --> 00:06:03,620
because it takes so much
attention to fly the approach

104
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:05,439
it has to be set up correctly

105
00:06:06,581 --> 00:06:08,481
American 1572
be advised

106
00:06:09,103 --> 00:06:12,868
the tower is closed at this time due
to the problem with one of the windows

107
00:06:13,308 --> 00:06:15,708
the non precision
approach and rough weather

108
00:06:15,781 --> 00:06:18,581
aren't the only
challenges facing the crew

109
00:06:19,222 --> 00:06:20,222
copy

110
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,200
there is a leaky
window in the tower

111
00:06:27,785 --> 00:06:28,785
at larger airports

112
00:06:29,219 --> 00:06:34,219
the control tower has two areas for
managing incoming and outgoing flights

113
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,641
approach control typically
located on one of the lower floors

114
00:06:38,263 --> 00:06:40,263
and tower control at the top

115
00:06:42,508 --> 00:06:46,540
Mark Guiod was the air traffic
manager at Bradley Airport for 12 years

116
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,561
once they're within
5 miles of the airport

117
00:06:49,562 --> 00:06:51,622
the approach controller
turns them over to the tower

118
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:54,685
and bring them in for landing
and taxi them to the gate

119
00:06:56,147 --> 00:06:58,647
but a leaky window
has shut down the tower

120
00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:03,342
forcing the air traffic
controller to leave her post

121
00:07:06,024 --> 00:07:08,928
tower controllers are the
pilot's eyes on the ground

122
00:07:09,148 --> 00:07:11,340
they're the ones that ensure
that the runway is sterile

123
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,120
and clear for them to land on

124
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:15,901
that there no obstruction
no other traffic

125
00:07:16,498 --> 00:07:20,361
they also provide critical information
in the late stages of the flight

126
00:07:23,825 --> 00:07:25,325
flaps 11 please

127
00:07:25,788 --> 00:07:26,788
you got it

128
00:07:28,859 --> 00:07:32,583
the pilots must now rely on their
own observations to land safely

129
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:40,103
the pilots were expecting
someone to be able to be in the tower

130
00:07:40,142 --> 00:07:41,142
the controller to see

131
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:45,220
the conditions of the runway and
to give them the information needed

132
00:07:45,221 --> 00:07:48,821
to see if anything during the
thunderstorm had blown up to the runway

133
00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:50,779
so they can make a safe landing

134
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,022
the approach controller is
closely monitoring the flight

135
00:07:56,585 --> 00:07:59,185
he notices the plane
is veering off course

136
00:07:59,661 --> 00:08:03,259
American 1572 looks like
you're a bit to the left of final

137
00:08:06,141 --> 00:08:07,842
yeah, looks like
we're left of it

138
00:08:08,143 --> 00:08:09,143
copy

139
00:08:10,424 --> 00:08:11,924
7 miles from the airport

140
00:08:12,146 --> 00:08:14,340
captain Lee gets the
plane back on course

141
00:08:17,781 --> 00:08:18,781
so gear down

142
00:08:22,304 --> 00:08:23,304
gear down

143
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,760
I'm going up to the tower

144
00:08:34,543 --> 00:08:36,843
the supervisor in
approach control volunteers

145
00:08:36,944 --> 00:08:40,044
to give the crew of flight
1572 some guidance

146
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:45,223
American 1572

147
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,658
there is someone in the
tower so unofficially open

148
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,521
but you can change
the tower frequency

149
00:08:51,904 --> 00:08:55,419
it would have been a big relief to
the crew to have someone in the tower

150
00:08:55,861 --> 00:08:59,402
the controller up there to give them the
information they need for the approach

151
00:09:00,383 --> 00:09:02,383
hey tower
American 1572

152
00:09:03,181 --> 00:09:05,581
we are 6 miles from runway 15

153
00:09:07,424 --> 00:09:09,424
landing is at your discretion

154
00:09:09,707 --> 00:09:11,607
the runway does
appear to be clear

155
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:12,690
copy

156
00:09:13,981 --> 00:09:17,343
any landing is really
at the pilot's discretion

157
00:09:18,223 --> 00:09:21,323
but in this particular case
they need to be extra vigilant

158
00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:23,901
because they didn't have
any official tower assistance

159
00:09:25,262 --> 00:09:26,262
flaps 14

160
00:09:27,263 --> 00:09:29,420
the pilots configure
the aircraft for landing

161
00:09:30,621 --> 00:09:32,221
flaps and slats to 40 40

162
00:09:32,862 --> 00:09:33,862
you're clear to land

163
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,900
10,000 feet

164
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,340
okay

165
00:09:44,864 --> 00:09:48,266
flight 1572 is just 60
seconds from touchdown

166
00:09:51,629 --> 00:09:52,629
what's up?

167
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,520
bells and whistles were going off
lights were flashing

168
00:09:57,862 --> 00:09:59,562
and something had to be done

169
00:10:02,747 --> 00:10:05,568
2.5 miles from Bradley
airport in Connecticut

170
00:10:06,088 --> 00:10:09,144
American airlines flight
1572 has struck something

171
00:10:09,665 --> 00:10:11,425
while descending to the runway

172
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,587
the pilots must act
quickly to avoid crashing

173
00:10:15,108 --> 00:10:16,108
go go around

174
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:17,248
going around

175
00:10:20,702 --> 00:10:23,265
they pull the nose up
in an attempt to recover

176
00:10:24,346 --> 00:10:26,585
flaps 15, positive rate, gear up

177
00:10:28,581 --> 00:10:29,581
gear up

178
00:10:30,383 --> 00:10:33,384
the crew immediately
began a go around procedure

179
00:10:33,786 --> 00:10:35,684
they raise the gear
they raise the flaps

180
00:10:36,185 --> 00:10:37,785
cram the engines forward

181
00:10:38,187 --> 00:10:40,920
and immediately after that
things went downhill very quickly

182
00:10:46,898 --> 00:10:47,898
left motor's failed

183
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,923
seconds after the pilot
commands the go around

184
00:10:51,983 --> 00:10:54,063
the plane's left
engine loses power

185
00:10:55,651 --> 00:10:58,980
that's the last thing you need to
have happen is a power failure

186
00:10:59,342 --> 00:11:00,342
on one of the engines

187
00:11:01,303 --> 00:11:03,103
there's runway straight ahead

188
00:11:04,586 --> 00:11:05,586
okay

189
00:11:06,586 --> 00:11:08,741
tell them we're going down
tell  emergency

190
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:09,801
hey tower

191
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,442
call for emergency equipment,
we're going down on the runway

192
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,120
looks like we've got an
emergency on 1572, send the trucks

193
00:11:19,982 --> 00:11:21,982
emergency vehicles
have been dispatched

194
00:11:23,184 --> 00:11:25,184
as the pilots prepare
for an emergency landing

195
00:11:25,939 --> 00:11:27,439
the situation worsens

196
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,522
the right engine also fails

197
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,923
turning the MD-83
into a 60 ton glider

198
00:11:34,659 --> 00:11:38,360
they realized they had a second
power failure which made double trouble

199
00:11:39,142 --> 00:11:41,984
without its engines the plane
has drifted further of course

200
00:11:44,226 --> 00:11:46,967
captain Lee tries to line
it back up with the runway

201
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:50,008
you gotta do it
you're gonna make it

202
00:11:50,099 --> 00:11:52,722
but they may not have
enough lift to reach it

203
00:11:53,988 --> 00:11:58,388
stall is an aerodynamic
effects when the winds lose lift

204
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,360
and the airplane
loses direction control

205
00:12:01,581 --> 00:12:04,926
the only way to fly out of a stall is
max power which they did not have

206
00:12:10,821 --> 00:12:11,821
hold on guy

207
00:12:15,303 --> 00:12:16,303
hold it down buddy

208
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:17,945
hold it down

209
00:12:19,066 --> 00:12:20,066
hold it down

210
00:12:23,861 --> 00:12:24,861
hold it down

211
00:12:36,062 --> 00:12:37,102
god bless you

212
00:12:37,783 --> 00:12:38,783
you made it

213
00:12:44,341 --> 00:12:46,902
it was a miracle that the
first officer saw the runway

214
00:12:46,903 --> 00:12:49,460
and the crew reacted so quickly
it was a very good reaction

215
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,041
and certainly saved
a lot of people lives

216
00:12:52,862 --> 00:12:58,359
flight 1572 has landed safely
after a treacherous final approach

217
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:06,065
everyone has survived and remarkably
only one person has suffered a minor injury

218
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:12,781
the pilots are hailed as heroes for
saving their plane and everyone on board

219
00:13:15,022 --> 00:13:17,822
one of the key things about
something like this is that

220
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:20,406
you never stop
flying the airplane

221
00:13:20,621 --> 00:13:22,999
and those who do
don't live to tell about it

222
00:13:25,698 --> 00:13:29,562
the events that nearly
brought down flight 1572

223
00:13:29,581 --> 00:13:31,081
are a complete mystery

224
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:33,804
what we've got so far?

225
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:39,370
it will be up to investigators from the
national transportation safety board (NTSB)

226
00:13:39,941 --> 00:13:40,941
to find the answers

227
00:13:41,944 --> 00:13:43,944
Bob Benzon heads up the team

228
00:13:44,384 --> 00:13:49,040
I was the investigator in charge with
about a dozen NTSB people underneath me

229
00:13:49,741 --> 00:13:51,741
plus many people
from the industry

230
00:13:53,145 --> 00:13:55,930
aircraft hit the ground hard
approaching the runway threshold

231
00:13:58,701 --> 00:14:01,002
maybe the engines had
something to do with it

232
00:14:01,503 --> 00:14:02,803
did a lost of engine power

233
00:14:02,944 --> 00:14:06,976
cause flight 1572 to crash-land
in front of the runway threshold?

234
00:14:10,223 --> 00:14:13,943
when we first arrived at the accident
site our first order of business was really

235
00:14:14,139 --> 00:14:16,562
to kind of do a reconnaissance
look at the aircraft

236
00:14:18,102 --> 00:14:20,422
this thing looks like
flew through a war zone

237
00:14:21,741 --> 00:14:23,641
and during our
initial examination

238
00:14:24,141 --> 00:14:27,624
the aircraft was very very
damaged, it reminded me of a

239
00:14:27,819 --> 00:14:30,619
something like a B-70
that had gone through

240
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:33,161
raid on schweinfurt
in world war 2

241
00:14:33,223 --> 00:14:34,823
it was beat to heck

242
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:38,981
branches sticking
out of a landing gear

243
00:14:39,261 --> 00:14:40,861
engine blade's missing

244
00:14:41,222 --> 00:14:42,222
battered flaps

245
00:14:44,059 --> 00:14:46,059
the aircraft was unflyable

246
00:14:47,742 --> 00:14:49,942
they definitely hit some trees
they sure did

247
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,281
and the engines definitely had
power and shredded those branches

248
00:14:55,539 --> 00:14:59,621
mangled branches in the plane's engines
indicate that they were working normally

249
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:02,890
the discovery raises
another question

250
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,200
if the engines had power

251
00:15:05,382 --> 00:15:07,062
why they hit the trees

252
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:16,582
the main question became why the
aircraft was low enough to hit trees

253
00:15:17,223 --> 00:15:18,923
and still make it to the runway

254
00:15:21,739 --> 00:15:23,739
if you're gonna analyze
an accident like this

255
00:15:23,741 --> 00:15:26,761
which is categorized as a
Controlled flight into terrain

256
00:15:26,784 --> 00:15:28,878
you have to understand
where the airplane went

257
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:30,880
and when it went there
and why it went there

258
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,841
where exactly did
they hit the trees?

259
00:15:43,782 --> 00:15:47,641
to understand why
flight 1572 struck trees

260
00:15:47,661 --> 00:15:51,283
investigators try to identify
the first point of impact

261
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,920
the trees they hit
are on top of the ridge

262
00:15:54,981 --> 00:15:57,059
about 2.5 miles north
west of the runway

263
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,159
we have a team out there now

264
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,263
let's see if the trees of the
ridge were marked on the chart

265
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:06,040
the approach chart itself when
you look at it have the ridge

266
00:16:06,301 --> 00:16:08,943
mark with the small
dot with the altitude

267
00:16:09,943 --> 00:16:11,543
the chart

268
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,840
has the top of the
ridge at 819 feet

269
00:16:14,462 --> 00:16:17,999
once we get a look at the approach
chart itself that the crew was using

270
00:16:18,381 --> 00:16:20,181
we noted that the ridge line

271
00:16:20,261 --> 00:16:24,780
was just a mere dot with a
number 819 next to it, an altitude

272
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,480
that dot could
have been anything

273
00:16:27,502 --> 00:16:29,102
could have been a
building, a giant tree

274
00:16:29,139 --> 00:16:32,680
other airlines use slightly different
chart that shows topographical features

275
00:16:32,821 --> 00:16:34,321
including this ridge line

276
00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:37,919
did flight 1572 come in too low

277
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,652
because there was a lack of
detail on their approach chart?

278
00:16:42,741 --> 00:16:44,803
do we have the
altitude for the tree strike?

279
00:16:45,863 --> 00:16:48,320
I need an altitude for
the first impact mark

280
00:16:57,382 --> 00:16:58,882
771 feet

281
00:17:00,504 --> 00:17:02,600
they should have been
anywhere near those trees

282
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:07,543
the team is surprised to discover
that when flight 1572 hit trees

283
00:17:07,823 --> 00:17:11,339
it was 48 feet below the
altitude listed for the ridge line

284
00:17:12,021 --> 00:17:14,021
they weren't just
below the ridge

285
00:17:14,261 --> 00:17:18,140
they dropped 309 feet below
the minimum descent altitude

286
00:17:24,022 --> 00:17:27,022
the minimum descent
altitude or MDA

287
00:17:27,102 --> 00:17:29,579
is the lowest altitude
a crew can decent to

288
00:17:29,659 --> 00:17:31,759
until they're able
to see the runway

289
00:17:33,624 --> 00:17:37,124
it's designed to keep planes
above terrains or obstructions

290
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,700
those altitudes
are hard altitudes

291
00:17:41,221 --> 00:17:43,721
when the FAA builds
those altitudes in there

292
00:17:44,059 --> 00:17:47,120
they have to take in
consideration of all the clearances

293
00:17:47,182 --> 00:17:48,682
the trees
the elevation

294
00:17:48,822 --> 00:17:50,902
to keep the airplane
at a safe altitude

295
00:17:51,579 --> 00:17:53,579
why would they dropped so low?

296
00:17:54,421 --> 00:17:56,741
maybe there is something
wrong with the altimeters

297
00:18:00,582 --> 00:18:03,346
investigators see the airplane
descended too low so the question is

298
00:18:03,424 --> 00:18:05,925
did the crew have
the correct indication?

299
00:18:06,468 --> 00:18:08,468
see if statistic
system is working

300
00:18:08,699 --> 00:18:10,840
Pitot–static system
was quite important

301
00:18:11,261 --> 00:18:13,861
because that system controls

302
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:15,944
altitude, altimeters

303
00:18:16,339 --> 00:18:18,339
it controls airspeed indicators

304
00:18:18,581 --> 00:18:21,581
and also controls the
vertical velocity indications

305
00:18:22,784 --> 00:18:26,480
did sensors provide incorrect
data to the plane's altimeters?

306
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:36,702
the MD-83 has three sets of
sensors on the exterior fuselage

307
00:18:37,624 --> 00:18:42,520
they measure air pressure to determine
airspeed, altitude and vertical speed

308
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:47,280
if one of the static sensors
is leaking or obstructed

309
00:18:47,422 --> 00:18:50,003
it can give pilots
inaccurate information

310
00:18:50,465 --> 00:18:54,160
making them think they're
above or below their actual altitude

311
00:18:55,821 --> 00:18:58,821
if the pitot tube is clogged

312
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:01,838
you lose those vital instruments

313
00:19:02,582 --> 00:19:03,582
and

314
00:19:03,703 --> 00:19:05,799
that can happen
from variety of reasons

315
00:19:07,904 --> 00:19:10,689
pitot static system have
caused problems before

316
00:19:11,259 --> 00:19:13,759
problem severe
enough to cause crashes

317
00:19:15,182 --> 00:19:16,182
ready?

318
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:17,422
yep

319
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:20,075
the test forces air
into the sensor

320
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:24,221
to determine if the air pressure
is being measured accurately

321
00:19:30,339 --> 00:19:32,339
but it proves to be a dead end

322
00:19:32,864 --> 00:19:35,064
the static system is working

323
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:37,259
okay

324
00:19:37,661 --> 00:19:40,461
let's see what the
controllers can tell us

325
00:19:40,782 --> 00:19:42,482
it's always valuable
to be able to speed to

326
00:19:42,523 --> 00:19:44,723
the air traffic controllers
after an accident

327
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:48,462
well often the air traffic controller is
the last person to speak to the crew

328
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:51,470
prior to an accident

329
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:55,063
did the crew report anything unusual
on their descent in the Windsor locks?

330
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:56,583
no

331
00:19:57,263 --> 00:19:58,863
it was standard approach

332
00:19:58,985 --> 00:20:01,568
but weather conditions
weren't great at a time

333
00:20:01,818 --> 00:20:02,818
were there any downdraft?

334
00:20:03,821 --> 00:20:07,904
did strong winds pushed
flight 1572 into the trees?

335
00:20:09,088 --> 00:20:11,888
if an airplane encounters
severe downdrafts

336
00:20:11,983 --> 00:20:14,502
it can push the airplane
down several hundred feet

337
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:17,882
wind shear poses
a danger to aircraft

338
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:24,741
in 1985 a severe downdraft slammed
Delta airlines flight 191 into the ground

339
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:28,063
more than a mile short of
the runway in Dallas taxes

340
00:20:29,544 --> 00:20:31,544
137 people lost their lives

341
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,180
in 1994

342
00:20:36,745 --> 00:20:40,142
a year before flight 1572
close call in Connecticut

343
00:20:41,003 --> 00:20:44,003
USA flight 1016 crash into trees

344
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:48,412
while attempting to land in a
powerful thunderstorm in north Carolina

345
00:20:48,438 --> 00:20:50,638
it plowed into a
residential neighborhood

346
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,980
killing 37 people

347
00:20:54,623 --> 00:20:57,223
thunder storm have
incredible wind shear

348
00:20:57,398 --> 00:20:59,599
they can have updrafts
200 miles an hour

349
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,220
and then
you know

350
00:21:02,221 --> 00:21:04,322
half a second later after
you passed through that

351
00:21:04,419 --> 00:21:06,419
you'd have downdraft
200 miles an hour

352
00:21:07,781 --> 00:21:09,822
there is a lot of wind
on the airport all night

353
00:21:10,063 --> 00:21:12,259
what about when this
flight was coming through?

354
00:21:16,543 --> 00:21:18,043
there was some wind shear

355
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:22,659
investigators learned that airport
sensors registered some down drafts

356
00:21:23,019 --> 00:21:25,019
we make sure to
give them updates

357
00:21:25,021 --> 00:21:26,721
like I said it was rough

358
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,443
so they knew what
they were flying into

359
00:21:28,464 --> 00:21:29,464
yes

360
00:21:30,184 --> 00:21:32,947
given a weather conditions
at the time and a unstable air

361
00:21:33,008 --> 00:21:36,659
investigators were able to determine
that they may have been down drafts

362
00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:38,819
up to 3 or 4 hundred
feet per minutes

363
00:21:38,941 --> 00:21:40,941
occurring at the
time of this event

364
00:21:40,942 --> 00:21:41,942
so

365
00:21:41,983 --> 00:21:43,583
if there was a downdraft

366
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,740
these guys would have
been prepared for it

367
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,180
oh yes

368
00:21:47,702 --> 00:21:52,780
it was possible that wind shear could have
pulled the aircraft down into the trees

369
00:21:53,621 --> 00:21:55,661
but a careful look at
the weather at the time

370
00:21:56,662 --> 00:21:59,164
after that we determine
that simply wasn't true

371
00:22:00,579 --> 00:22:02,639
was there anything else
out of ordinary that night?

372
00:22:02,681 --> 00:22:03,681
besides the weather

373
00:22:04,422 --> 00:22:06,462
well the tower was
shutdown at that time

374
00:22:07,819 --> 00:22:08,819
leaky window

375
00:22:09,219 --> 00:22:12,001
one of our supervisors went up
to make sure they landed okay

376
00:22:12,061 --> 00:22:14,099
you mean the tower was
down during their approach

377
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,460
yes

378
00:22:17,261 --> 00:22:19,479
I'd like to speak to the
supervisor who was in the tower

379
00:22:19,499 --> 00:22:20,499
sure
of course

380
00:22:21,461 --> 00:22:28,220
did flight 1572 slammed into trees
due to lack of guidance from the tower?

381
00:22:31,022 --> 00:22:34,155
air traffic control worker is
demanding and it's precise job

382
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,440
if there any major disruptions

383
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:40,203
either in the tower or
at Donna radar scope

384
00:22:40,747 --> 00:22:44,280
it could effect
aircraft traffic greatly

385
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:47,362
were there any signs the crew
was having trouble during approach?

386
00:22:47,907 --> 00:22:48,907
not really

387
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:52,181
it was all normal until
they called the emergency

388
00:22:52,981 --> 00:22:55,081
take me through what happened

389
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:57,260
they were already 6 miles out

390
00:22:57,461 --> 00:22:59,141
lined up with the runway

391
00:22:59,402 --> 00:23:01,679
runway looked clear so I
told them they could land

392
00:23:02,181 --> 00:23:04,181
we're 6 miles from runway 15

393
00:23:06,703 --> 00:23:08,303
landing is at your discretion

394
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:10,708
the runway does
appear to be clear

395
00:23:10,979 --> 00:23:11,979
copy

396
00:23:14,622 --> 00:23:16,642
did you give them an
actual clearance for landing?

397
00:23:18,265 --> 00:23:19,785
the tower was closed

398
00:23:19,859 --> 00:23:21,559
I can only give advisories

399
00:23:21,641 --> 00:23:24,161
it's up to them to decide
after that if they want to land

400
00:23:25,058 --> 00:23:27,601
advisories are just
information provided to the pilot

401
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,500
for their own use

402
00:23:29,623 --> 00:23:33,559
they can listen to it they
cannot listen to it, its up to them

403
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,580
in this case the
tower was not open

404
00:23:35,778 --> 00:23:38,860
so therefore he didn't have
authority to issued any clearance

405
00:23:39,381 --> 00:23:44,184
investigators still don't know if poor
weather and a closed control tower

406
00:23:44,425 --> 00:23:48,508
caused the pilots to drop below
the minimum descent altitude

407
00:23:48,948 --> 00:23:49,948
what's up?

408
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,380
and into the trees

409
00:24:00,226 --> 00:24:03,860
let's start at 12:53 when
the crew contacts the tower

410
00:24:05,582 --> 00:24:10,682
investigators turned to the cockpit voice
recording of flight 1572's final approach

411
00:24:11,739 --> 00:24:15,823
to determine why the plane
drops too low and flew into trees

412
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:23,420
landing is at your discretion
the runway does appear to be clear

413
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:26,779
and what is showing
right now for winds?

414
00:24:28,861 --> 00:24:29,861
170 at 24

415
00:24:32,185 --> 00:24:33,185
copy

416
00:24:33,585 --> 00:24:36,699
he's checking the runway
giving weather updates

417
00:24:36,939 --> 00:24:38,639
it's all the job so far

418
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,423
the team listens to the supervisors
giving the crew guidance to help them land

419
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:46,820
it was a good initiative
for him to do that

420
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,910
it was something some people would
not have done based on the fact that the

421
00:24:49,942 --> 00:24:52,080
the tower itself was a
bit of a precarious area

422
00:24:53,621 --> 00:24:54,621
flaps 40

423
00:24:59,779 --> 00:25:01,459
flaps and slats to 40 40

424
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,420
you are clear to land

425
00:25:03,741 --> 00:25:04,741
okay

426
00:25:04,863 --> 00:25:06,863
give me a thousand down
one thousand down

427
00:25:10,187 --> 00:25:11,187
you got it

428
00:25:12,459 --> 00:25:13,459
stop that

429
00:25:14,821 --> 00:25:15,821
a thousand feet a minute

430
00:25:16,503 --> 00:25:17,503
no way

431
00:25:17,863 --> 00:25:19,403
as they neared the ground

432
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:24,020
the crew decided to make their
final decent at 1000 feet per minute

433
00:25:24,501 --> 00:25:26,501
nearly double what is normal

434
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,180
that in my mind
is quite excessive

435
00:25:31,267 --> 00:25:33,267
you didn't have to
descend that steeply

436
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:36,566
specially on non
precision approach

437
00:25:36,584 --> 00:25:39,746
where you have a minimum descent altitude
that you should not be going bellow

438
00:25:40,224 --> 00:25:44,322
the faster you descending the
earlier you have to start leveling off

439
00:25:44,402 --> 00:25:46,569
or else you end up going
bellow the target altitude

440
00:25:46,584 --> 00:25:48,625
by the time you correct
and come back up again

441
00:25:50,461 --> 00:25:52,461
according to the descent profile

442
00:25:52,544 --> 00:25:54,544
they're 5 miles from
the airport at 1900 feet

443
00:25:55,945 --> 00:25:59,060
using the Radar beacon
data from air traffic control

444
00:25:59,741 --> 00:26:04,744
investigators track flight 1572's cockpit
conversation throughout the descent

445
00:26:06,503 --> 00:26:08,103
at a 1000 feet per minute

446
00:26:09,065 --> 00:26:11,732
they're bellow their
MDA in less than a minute

447
00:26:12,185 --> 00:26:15,242
sure that's fast but the first officer
should be calling the altitudes

448
00:26:16,105 --> 00:26:20,508
while the aircraft descending the pilot is
supposed to monitor the airplane's MDA

449
00:26:20,527 --> 00:26:22,327
minimum descent altitude

450
00:26:22,389 --> 00:26:24,802
the first officer should call a
1000 above MDA to the captain

451
00:26:25,502 --> 00:26:27,602
and then 100 foot to the MDA

452
00:26:28,303 --> 00:26:30,003
and then the MDA altitude

453
00:26:30,866 --> 00:26:31,866
okay

454
00:26:32,268 --> 00:26:34,086
let's listen to the
first officer call out

455
00:26:39,302 --> 00:26:40,802
there is the 1000 feet

456
00:26:41,026 --> 00:26:42,026
good

457
00:26:42,586 --> 00:26:44,186
he made a 1000 for call out

458
00:26:44,861 --> 00:26:47,922
but they don't hear any
more call outs after that

459
00:26:49,664 --> 00:26:52,627
the first officer called out
the 1000 foot above the MDA

460
00:26:53,618 --> 00:26:56,660
he did not call out the
100 foot above the MDA

461
00:26:58,143 --> 00:27:00,584
investigators then
hear something unusual

462
00:27:04,306 --> 00:27:05,306
a 1000 ..
right

463
00:27:09,102 --> 00:27:10,102
you're going bellow your

464
00:27:13,744 --> 00:27:14,744
what's up?

465
00:27:16,861 --> 00:27:17,861
hang on

466
00:27:18,701 --> 00:27:20,702
was that the minimum
descent altitude call out?

467
00:27:20,978 --> 00:27:22,778
I think it was supposed to be

468
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:27,783
the team discovers that the first
officer mishandled the remaining call outs

469
00:27:29,667 --> 00:27:31,767
the first officer
started to call out

470
00:27:32,771 --> 00:27:34,800
for the MDA but never
finished the sentence

471
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,780
so he makes half at their minimum

472
00:27:38,702 --> 00:27:41,761
and then doesn't say anything
else until they're bellow it

473
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,040
and by then they hit the trees

474
00:27:45,462 --> 00:27:48,964
why did the pilots make such a
critical error so close to landing?

475
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,940
let's talk to the pilots

476
00:27:54,782 --> 00:27:58,404
this particular case we were very
fortunate to have live crew to interview

477
00:27:58,748 --> 00:28:02,641
we wanna to determine exactly what they
were thinking about during the accident?

478
00:28:07,184 --> 00:28:08,684
walk me through your actions

479
00:28:08,718 --> 00:28:11,801
4 miles from the airport as you
approach minimum descent altitude

480
00:28:13,263 --> 00:28:16,265
the weather was rough, we
were two hours late departing

481
00:28:16,387 --> 00:28:18,387
I was monitoring the instruments

482
00:28:23,343 --> 00:28:24,343
a 1000 ...
so you're

483
00:28:24,785 --> 00:28:25,785
right

484
00:28:28,302 --> 00:28:29,302
okay
and then what

485
00:28:30,585 --> 00:28:33,003
as we got closer to the
minimum descent altitude

486
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:37,347
I looked outside for the airport

487
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,502
and when I looked back
we were bellow minimums

488
00:28:45,387 --> 00:28:47,654
you're going bellow your

489
00:28:49,871 --> 00:28:51,771
during that time
he was looking out

490
00:28:51,883 --> 00:28:55,522
he was not monitoring the flight
gauges as closely as he should have been

491
00:28:55,862 --> 00:28:58,862
this case the appropriate
procedure would have had

492
00:28:58,979 --> 00:29:02,102
the first officer glue to the
altimeter and the compass

493
00:29:02,661 --> 00:29:05,761
and other instruments
in the cockpit

494
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,940
until the captain said
I see the runway

495
00:29:08,742 --> 00:29:10,786
why didn't you go for go around?

496
00:29:10,855 --> 00:29:11,855
well there was no time

497
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,419
we immediately hit the trees

498
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,320
it was a stressful night

499
00:29:24,182 --> 00:29:26,683
it could be a bit of task
saturation in there

500
00:29:26,947 --> 00:29:28,847
this went from an easy

501
00:29:28,859 --> 00:29:32,919
kind of relax flight with the
little bit of weather difficulty to

502
00:29:32,982 --> 00:29:35,543
oh my gosh, everything's
going wrong really really fast

503
00:29:39,982 --> 00:29:40,982
something doesn't add up

504
00:29:41,703 --> 00:29:45,440
the first officer couldn't have been on his
minimum seconds before hitting the trees

505
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,200
maybe there was an issue
with the altimeter settings

506
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:54,622
pilots must calibrate the altimeters
based on outside air pressure

507
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:57,861
which can change dramatically
in extreme weather conditions

508
00:29:58,982 --> 00:30:01,982
pilots frequently
recalibrate the altimeters

509
00:30:02,463 --> 00:30:04,463
to maintain an
accurate altitude reading

510
00:30:05,861 --> 00:30:07,361
altimeter setting
is very important

511
00:30:07,445 --> 00:30:09,245
you can't do a approach
in bad weather unless

512
00:30:09,283 --> 00:30:11,255
you know the altitude
your airplane is

513
00:30:11,346 --> 00:30:13,346
let's see what setting they used

514
00:30:18,941 --> 00:30:20,381
it's a lot of rain

515
00:30:20,661 --> 00:30:21,781
I can see that

516
00:30:22,102 --> 00:30:25,463
in this case cut of this storming
that was going through that area

517
00:30:25,504 --> 00:30:27,180
the pressure was falling rapidly

518
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:29,948
and when that happens your
altimeter setting goes down quickly

519
00:30:29,982 --> 00:30:31,982
means if you don't
reset your altitude

520
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,720
then your airplane is flying
lower that you think it is

521
00:30:41,219 --> 00:30:42,219
here

522
00:30:42,901 --> 00:30:46,144
the dispatcher updated them
with an altimeter setting 29.23

523
00:30:47,424 --> 00:30:52,500
NTSB investigators check whether
the pilots of American airlines flight 1572

524
00:30:53,061 --> 00:30:56,980
properly set the altimeter during
the stormy approach into Bradley airport

525
00:30:58,661 --> 00:31:00,561
what time is that?
12:30 am

526
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,841
that was 25 minutes
before they hit the trees

527
00:31:07,623 --> 00:31:09,623
and with the changing
weather conditions

528
00:31:09,624 --> 00:31:12,179
they must have received
an update from Bradley ATC

529
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:18,179
but one thing that the crew considers
and expects from the tower or air traffic

530
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:21,061
is the update of the
weather as quick as possible

531
00:31:21,422 --> 00:31:24,667
so they can also amend
what they need to do

532
00:31:26,143 --> 00:31:27,143
okay

533
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:29,223
they first contact the
approach control at 12:43

534
00:31:30,865 --> 00:31:32,565
Bradley approach
American 1572

535
00:31:33,105 --> 00:31:34,105
we are 11,000 feet

536
00:31:35,619 --> 00:31:38,043
investigators expect
the approach controller

537
00:31:38,141 --> 00:31:40,274
to give the crew a
weather updates

538
00:31:40,305 --> 00:31:42,305
including the altimeter
pressure setting

539
00:31:43,941 --> 00:31:47,083
the approach control issue the
altimeter setting on initial contact

540
00:31:47,345 --> 00:31:49,346
when an arriving aircraft
enters their aerospace

541
00:31:50,145 --> 00:31:55,262
the altimeter is displayed as a
digital display in controls tower as well

542
00:31:57,142 --> 00:31:59,384
American 1572
Bradley approach roger

543
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:02,180
expect VOR runway 15 approach

544
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:06,622
but the update is never provided

545
00:32:08,219 --> 00:32:10,961
approach didn't update
their altimeter setting

546
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:13,108
even though the pressure
was dropping rapidly

547
00:32:14,744 --> 00:32:16,244
there is nothing at
all from approach

548
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,400
right up until he passes
them off to the tower

549
00:32:19,262 --> 00:32:22,482
why wouldn't the approach
controller give them a weather update?

550
00:32:22,663 --> 00:32:24,163
good question
let's ask him

551
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:29,601
one thing that puzzled the
investigators was why the

552
00:32:29,801 --> 00:32:32,101
air traffic controllers
in the Bradley tower

553
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:35,701
didn't keep the pilots update
with the current altimeter setting?

554
00:32:36,783 --> 00:32:39,399
you mention before that the
weather was quite active that night

555
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:41,541
yes, it was changing
quickly all night

556
00:32:42,042 --> 00:32:45,279
what was the airport altimeter
setting at the time of the accident?

557
00:32:45,639 --> 00:32:46,639
let me see

558
00:32:48,701 --> 00:32:49,701
29.15

559
00:32:51,383 --> 00:32:53,583
investigators learned
that the altimeter

560
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:56,060
pressure setting at
the time of the accident

561
00:32:56,221 --> 00:32:59,083
was not the setting the
pilot were originally given

562
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:01,919
why didn't the crew
receive an updated setting?

563
00:33:15,302 --> 00:33:17,302
I didn't think to
give it to them

564
00:33:20,669 --> 00:33:23,561
sometimes things that you
do over and over and over again

565
00:33:24,861 --> 00:33:25,861
become

566
00:33:26,302 --> 00:33:27,302
too routine

567
00:33:27,443 --> 00:33:28,443
and

568
00:33:29,544 --> 00:33:31,707
late at night when there
is not whole lot going on

569
00:33:32,339 --> 00:33:34,900
sometimes those are the
things that dropped to the cracks

570
00:33:35,141 --> 00:33:37,979
we warned about
that excuse a little bit

571
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,040
but this was what he said

572
00:33:40,161 --> 00:33:43,058
so the pilots didn't have
the current altimeter setting

573
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,500
when they flew the approach

574
00:33:46,902 --> 00:33:49,924
we got the altimeter setting
for the time of the accident

575
00:33:51,058 --> 00:33:53,158
comparing the two
altimeter settings

576
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:57,142
will reveal how much lower the plane
was flying than it should have been

577
00:33:58,699 --> 00:33:59,699
0.08

578
00:34:01,701 --> 00:34:03,301
the difference in
the altimeter setting

579
00:34:03,663 --> 00:34:05,763
from what they had
put on their instruments

580
00:34:05,906 --> 00:34:09,000
to what was a reality was
about 0.08 inches of mercury

581
00:34:09,301 --> 00:34:10,801
which equates to 76 feet

582
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:14,139
because the pilots
updated setting

583
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:18,062
they thought they were 76 feet
higher than they actually were

584
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,900
the discovery is eye opening

585
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:26,023
once you get close to the
ground 76 feet is a big deal

586
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:28,359
once you're coming across
the minimum descent altitude

587
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,161
and you have to keep the airplane
level at minimum descent altitude

588
00:34:31,462 --> 00:34:32,462
76 feet is critical

589
00:34:33,464 --> 00:34:34,464
the question is

590
00:34:34,904 --> 00:34:37,404
would they have hit anything
if they have been 76 higher?

591
00:34:39,101 --> 00:34:43,040
well we know they struck
the trees at an altitude 771 feet

592
00:34:43,761 --> 00:34:44,861
add 76 feet to that

593
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:47,342
they would have hit anything

594
00:34:47,363 --> 00:34:48,363
no impact

595
00:34:48,788 --> 00:34:50,788
if they had the
correct altimeter setting

596
00:34:51,619 --> 00:34:53,619
even though they
went blew the MDA

597
00:34:53,621 --> 00:34:56,002
they still were
gonna be 76 higher

598
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:01,350
and we probably wouldn't
be talking about this right now

599
00:35:01,379 --> 00:35:03,020
because they would
have missed the trees

600
00:35:03,061 --> 00:35:07,139
that is an explain why they are 309
feet bellow the minimum descent altitude

601
00:35:08,619 --> 00:35:10,119
76 feet of that are ATC

602
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,900
the other 233
feet are pilot error

603
00:35:14,824 --> 00:35:17,448
this was out of the control
of the pilots to a certain extent

604
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:18,949
that going bellow the MDA

605
00:35:20,499 --> 00:35:24,121
should have been caught by
both the first officer and the captain

606
00:35:24,183 --> 00:35:26,183
this is what
created the accident

607
00:35:32,621 --> 00:35:34,861
in the end they came
down to the crew's decision

608
00:35:35,183 --> 00:35:39,645
investigators now understand
what happened to flight 1572

609
00:35:41,042 --> 00:35:43,642
the outdated altimeter setting
and the rough weather

610
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:46,782
made that the crew had almost
no room for error on the approach

611
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:50,664
and when they were descending too fast
and passed their minimum descent altitude

612
00:35:50,738 --> 00:35:53,799
there was no way they could
recover before hitting the trees

613
00:35:55,262 --> 00:35:57,762
only one question
remains unanswered

614
00:35:58,904 --> 00:36:00,904
in spite of hitting the trees

615
00:36:01,138 --> 00:36:02,700
how did they make that landing?

616
00:36:12,107 --> 00:36:13,607
here is the FDR data

617
00:36:16,061 --> 00:36:20,144
NTSB investigators turn to
flight 1572's flight data recorder

618
00:36:21,424 --> 00:36:24,524
to learn how the crew
managed to recover their jet

619
00:36:24,547 --> 00:36:26,547
after they struck the trees

620
00:36:27,939 --> 00:36:28,939
so

621
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,960
they hit the trees
and immediately

622
00:36:32,022 --> 00:36:35,286
pulled the flaps back to
15 and go to max thrust

623
00:36:36,226 --> 00:36:40,299
the data shows that the crew quickly
configure the plane for a go around

624
00:36:41,581 --> 00:36:42,581
go go around
going around

625
00:36:49,745 --> 00:36:50,745
flaps 15

626
00:36:51,308 --> 00:36:52,908
positive rate
gear up

627
00:36:54,139 --> 00:36:55,139
gear up

628
00:36:56,821 --> 00:36:57,821
then

629
00:36:57,942 --> 00:36:59,462
just as they begin
their go around

630
00:36:59,943 --> 00:37:01,643
they lose their left engine

631
00:37:06,702 --> 00:37:08,802
the aircraft actually ingested

632
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:13,761
trees, the tops of the
trees into the engines

633
00:37:15,142 --> 00:37:16,142
left motor's failed

634
00:37:17,145 --> 00:37:19,145
followed by their right engine

635
00:37:23,621 --> 00:37:25,621
here you have a scenario where

636
00:37:25,683 --> 00:37:27,083
something devastated
just happened

637
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,301
we just plow through some
trees on a top of the ridge

638
00:37:29,341 --> 00:37:31,381
2.5 miles away from
the runway and losing

639
00:37:31,902 --> 00:37:34,465
capabilities on this
aircraft by the second

640
00:37:34,745 --> 00:37:36,645
they've go the nose way up

641
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:39,200
they're losing the speed and
both of their engines are gone

642
00:37:39,502 --> 00:37:41,562
that's recipe for stall if
I have already see one

643
00:37:42,063 --> 00:37:44,905
all of a sudden they were
starting to lose airspeed

644
00:37:44,905 --> 00:37:48,420
they're in a nose high altitude and
that's worse time that could happen

645
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,661
airspeed is what
makes the airplane flying

646
00:37:51,722 --> 00:37:53,923
if there isn't enough air
moving over the wings

647
00:37:53,984 --> 00:37:54,984
the wings stop flying

648
00:37:55,386 --> 00:37:57,386
and that is what
refer to as stall

649
00:37:58,781 --> 00:38:00,781
there is a runway straight ahead

650
00:38:02,183 --> 00:38:04,478
fortunately the first
officer saw the runway

651
00:38:04,479 --> 00:38:06,900
they had to get the airplane
on the ground in a hurry

652
00:38:07,022 --> 00:38:10,123
because it would not be able to keep
on flying with the engine power they had

653
00:38:10,424 --> 00:38:11,424
okay

654
00:38:11,865 --> 00:38:14,265
tell them we are going down
tell them the emergency

655
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,520
so now he's gonna
reconfigure the aircraft again

656
00:38:16,702 --> 00:38:18,642
and remember this is
all happening in seconds

657
00:38:18,703 --> 00:38:23,040
he's gotta focus on trying to save
whatever altitude and airspeed he has left

658
00:38:23,742 --> 00:38:26,162
to make it across the fence
into the runway environment

659
00:38:26,903 --> 00:38:28,603
this is a critical
stage of flight now

660
00:38:28,899 --> 00:38:30,599
because he doesn't have power

661
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,323
all he can do is trade
altitude for airspeed

662
00:38:33,402 --> 00:38:35,544
and we know their flaps
were all the way down 40

663
00:38:36,784 --> 00:38:37,784
flaps 40
all the way down

664
00:38:39,619 --> 00:38:41,119
they're all the way down

665
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:44,201
he's gonna generate something else
that's gonna get them across the fence

666
00:38:44,503 --> 00:38:46,664
and that's why he
drops 40 degrees flaps

667
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:50,360
the drag from the
flaps slows them down

668
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,741
but for the first few
seconds it balloons them up

669
00:38:53,262 --> 00:38:56,062
40 degrees of flaps
change the curve of the wing

670
00:38:56,105 --> 00:38:58,105
which increases
the lift of the wing

671
00:38:59,498 --> 00:39:01,501
and gives him that
extra little bounce

672
00:39:02,902 --> 00:39:04,602
to get a little bit further

673
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:08,243
if he had not have done that of if
he would have delayed it a little bit

674
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:12,260
the accident could have
been totally catastrophic

675
00:39:12,422 --> 00:39:14,422
you got it dude
you're gonna make it

676
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,740
and glide down to the runway

677
00:39:19,783 --> 00:39:22,838
unfortunately they didn't have
quite enough airspeed and altitudes

678
00:39:22,899 --> 00:39:23,899
so they landed early

679
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,902
kind of scooted and flopped
onto pavement of the runway

680
00:39:35,299 --> 00:39:38,342
they made mistakes going
into the tree strike if you will

681
00:39:39,263 --> 00:39:42,359
and yet did brilliant
job landing the aircraft

682
00:39:44,301 --> 00:39:46,863
that's an incredible
show of airman ship

683
00:39:53,539 --> 00:39:56,702
the crew was actually excellent
in cockpit resource management

684
00:39:57,222 --> 00:40:00,288
in the very difficult situation that
occurred after they the ridge line

685
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:02,460
they cooperated

686
00:40:03,581 --> 00:40:04,581
they didn't panic

687
00:40:05,582 --> 00:40:09,061
they way these two pilots
work together was remarkable

688
00:40:09,081 --> 00:40:10,081
and

689
00:40:10,102 --> 00:40:13,458
one of the last thing that's on the tape
that's kind of really gives you a chill

690
00:40:13,463 --> 00:40:15,984
is after they make the
runway the first officer says

691
00:40:17,139 --> 00:40:18,179
god bless you

692
00:40:18,301 --> 00:40:19,301
you made it

693
00:40:21,983 --> 00:40:25,604
this is an accident that probably
is not well known to a lot of people

694
00:40:25,947 --> 00:40:30,642
and that's because the aircraft was able
to end up on runway and no body was killed

695
00:40:33,823 --> 00:40:38,007
the captain's impressive recovery
doesn't make up for the crew's errors

696
00:40:38,819 --> 00:40:43,001
the NTSB's final report concludes
that the probable cause of this accident

697
00:40:43,343 --> 00:40:46,143
was the crew flying bellow
the minimum descent altitude

698
00:40:46,305 --> 00:40:48,305
before they could see the runway

699
00:40:51,099 --> 00:40:54,399
we think in essence the
main factor involved in

700
00:40:54,502 --> 00:40:57,802
in the accident was the fact
that the pilots didn't monitor

701
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:00,580
the altitudes they were
flying through correctly

702
00:41:01,622 --> 00:41:04,699
they should have level off at a
point and they simply did not do so

703
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:07,579
following the accident

704
00:41:07,602 --> 00:41:10,983
American airlines increase
the MDA requirement by 100 feet

705
00:41:11,183 --> 00:41:13,967
and visibility
requirement by half a mile

706
00:41:13,985 --> 00:41:16,929
for non-precision
approaches to Bradley airport

707
00:41:18,221 --> 00:41:19,221
it's a lot of rain

708
00:41:20,782 --> 00:41:24,979
the NTSB also recommends that in conditions
where pressure is falling rapidly

709
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:29,783
controllers should issue altimeter
setting updates as frequently as possible

710
00:41:30,907 --> 00:41:33,507
the approach controller issues
the current altimeter setting

711
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:34,741
that didn't happen either

712
00:41:35,741 --> 00:41:40,500
right, what's important to understand
though in terms of responsibility is that

713
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:43,021
the captain is the final
authority on the flight

714
00:41:43,583 --> 00:41:45,383
it's ultimately the
captain's responsibility

715
00:41:45,403 --> 00:41:47,670
to ensure the
safety of the flight

716
00:41:47,946 --> 00:41:51,280
in this case he didn't ensure that he
had the most current altimeter setting

717
00:41:53,022 --> 00:41:54,822
this accident was
important to me

718
00:41:55,499 --> 00:41:57,699
because it was one of the few

719
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,400
where no body was killed
no body was hurt

720
00:42:00,863 --> 00:42:04,025
and yet the safety board came up
with some pretty good recommendations

721
00:42:04,547 --> 00:42:06,819
to mitigate some of
the factors that existed
