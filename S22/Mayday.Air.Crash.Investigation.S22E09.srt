1
00:00:02,224 --> 00:00:04,224
on approach to
Raleigh–Durham Airport

2
00:00:05,946 --> 00:00:07,946
did we just have a flameout?

3
00:00:08,227 --> 00:00:10,027
the pilots decide
to abort their landing

4
00:00:10,781 --> 00:00:12,081
when you have an engine failure

5
00:00:12,161 --> 00:00:14,103
you lose 80 percent
of your performance

6
00:00:14,955 --> 00:00:15,955
let's go
miss approach

7
00:00:17,181 --> 00:00:18,681
but the plan falls apart

8
00:00:21,983 --> 00:00:22,983
we were going down

9
00:00:29,861 --> 00:00:32,383
only five of the 20
people on board survived

10
00:00:34,624 --> 00:00:38,641
NTSB investigators are puzzled
by the wreckage of flight 3379

11
00:00:39,621 --> 00:00:42,179
it appears the engines
were rotating full power

12
00:00:43,299 --> 00:00:44,299
so what went wrong?

13
00:00:45,022 --> 00:00:47,864
only by taking a test
flight to the brink of disaster

14
00:00:48,424 --> 00:00:49,424
flying to the left

15
00:00:50,385 --> 00:00:53,219
will an astonishing sequence
of events be revealed

16
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,940
this airplane had to crash

17
00:01:24,347 --> 00:01:29,141
American Eagle Flight 3379 approaches
Raleigh–Durham International Airport

18
00:01:31,743 --> 00:01:32,743
okay

19
00:01:32,924 --> 00:01:34,944
can you do the descent
checklist please?

20
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:39,299
in the cockpit

21
00:01:39,701 --> 00:01:40,701
Captain Michael Hillis

22
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:42,843
and First Officer Matthew Sailor

23
00:01:42,863 --> 00:01:43,863
prepare for landing

24
00:01:45,426 --> 00:01:47,938
altimeter 3031
set, cross checked

25
00:01:49,339 --> 00:01:52,081
3031 set
cross checked

26
00:01:53,582 --> 00:01:56,619
these were young pilots
just starting off in their career

27
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,222
they were looking to go
work at the major airlines

28
00:01:59,782 --> 00:02:02,063
where the pay and benefits
were substantially better

29
00:02:04,585 --> 00:02:07,408
the pilots are flying
a jet stream 3201

30
00:02:07,987 --> 00:02:09,487
a twin turboprop airplane

31
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:11,208
designed for short flights

32
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,059
it's a workhorse for regional
airlines like American eagle

33
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,583
turboprop engines run more
efficiently at lower altitudes

34
00:02:20,143 --> 00:02:22,104
they're actually
more fuel efficient

35
00:02:22,425 --> 00:02:24,425
so on these short haul routes

36
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:27,341
the jet stream pretty
much fit that market

37
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:33,062
flight 3379 took off at 6:00 pm

38
00:02:33,382 --> 00:02:35,382
from Greensboro North Carolina

39
00:02:36,219 --> 00:02:39,061
it's 35 minute flight to
Raleigh–Durham airport

40
00:02:40,182 --> 00:02:41,182
well folks at this time

41
00:02:41,343 --> 00:02:44,975
we're about 10.8 miles from
Raleigh–Durham International Airport

42
00:02:44,985 --> 00:02:47,467
about five minutes out, we're
about to begin our approach

43
00:02:47,548 --> 00:02:49,348
weather tonight is not
very good at Raleigh

44
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:51,469
2 mile of visibility
because of rain and fog

45
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,650
and winds towards the
north 6 miles an hour

46
00:02:57,183 --> 00:02:59,223
there are 18 passengers
on board tonight

47
00:03:00,544 --> 00:03:03,619
among them college
student Lauren Anderson

48
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:06,059
I had been up the night before

49
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,960
I'd stayed up all night
holding all nighter

50
00:03:07,981 --> 00:03:11,448
wrote a paper and slid under
the door of my English professor

51
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:12,909
that morning

52
00:03:13,071 --> 00:03:14,071
so I was pretty tired

53
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,200
it'd been long week of finals

54
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,700
I was ready to get home

55
00:03:20,898 --> 00:03:22,898
Eagle Flight 3379

56
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:26,383
reduce to 170 then
descent and maintain 3,000

57
00:03:29,179 --> 00:03:31,079
10 miles from Raleigh–Durham

58
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,483
flight 3379 is clear
to begin its descent

59
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:39,019
170 then 3,000
3379

60
00:03:43,983 --> 00:03:46,545
the flight crew
reduces engine power

61
00:03:50,422 --> 00:03:51,422
in a turboprop plane

62
00:03:52,142 --> 00:03:56,219
the engine power and the propeller
speed are controlled separately

63
00:03:57,379 --> 00:03:59,379
the jet stream 32
had no autopilot

64
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:01,221
so

65
00:04:01,382 --> 00:04:03,182
you were always hand-flying

66
00:04:05,301 --> 00:04:09,824
it was one of the most demanding
airplanes on the pilot's flying skills

67
00:04:12,904 --> 00:04:14,604
descending to 3,000 feet

68
00:04:14,906 --> 00:04:17,019
the crew keeps a
close eye on the weather

69
00:04:21,342 --> 00:04:22,342
get a chance

70
00:04:22,743 --> 00:04:25,259
look at your window and
see if you see any of that ice

71
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:30,104
yeah I was looking out there
I don't see anything right now

72
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,662
icing can be a major
threat to an aircraft

73
00:04:35,982 --> 00:04:38,443
and not only increases
the weight of it

74
00:04:38,503 --> 00:04:41,019
but also spoils the
aerodynamics over the wing

75
00:04:43,223 --> 00:04:46,224
icing isn't the only
hazard facing the pilots

76
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:51,501
Eagle Flight 3379
caution wake turbulence

77
00:04:51,962 --> 00:04:53,462
you're spacing on a 727

78
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,180
turn left 190

79
00:04:57,863 --> 00:05:01,265
there is 727 landing
ahead of flight 3379

80
00:05:02,105 --> 00:05:05,140
which creates a potential
hazard for the jet stream

81
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:11,303
heavy aircraft tend to generate
very strong horizontal tornadoes

82
00:05:11,865 --> 00:05:12,865
called vortexes

83
00:05:13,865 --> 00:05:15,465
that come off the wing tips

84
00:05:16,987 --> 00:05:21,221
if small aircraft has an
encounter with wake turbulence

85
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:26,365
it could be so powerful
that it's beyond the control

86
00:05:26,504 --> 00:05:28,184
of the pilot to counteract it

87
00:05:29,867 --> 00:05:31,367
left 190
3379

88
00:05:35,221 --> 00:05:39,186
for safety the pilots make a
minor adjustment to their course

89
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,680
eagle flight 3379
Raleigh

90
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,860
clear to land

91
00:05:43,941 --> 00:05:44,941
wind

92
00:05:45,342 --> 00:05:46,342
010 at 8

93
00:05:47,343 --> 00:05:48,343
traffic 3.5 mile final
727

94
00:05:50,946 --> 00:05:52,446
clear to land
3379

95
00:05:55,663 --> 00:05:57,663
once the Boeing 727 touches down

96
00:05:58,504 --> 00:06:01,345
flight 3379 will
be clear to land

97
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:08,259
we didn't anticipate any issues

98
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,560
it was the same old same old

99
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,921
I probably had taken that
flight 3 times already that year

100
00:06:18,905 --> 00:06:19,905
and gear down

101
00:06:21,467 --> 00:06:22,467
gear down

102
00:06:24,589 --> 00:06:26,259
the pilots configure
the plane for landing

103
00:06:27,941 --> 00:06:28,941
flaps 20

104
00:06:31,823 --> 00:06:32,823
flaps 20

105
00:06:34,386 --> 00:06:36,386
just minutes before touch down

106
00:06:40,022 --> 00:06:42,022
why is that ignition light on?

107
00:06:42,025 --> 00:06:43,725
did we just have a flameout?

108
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,620
the engine ignition
light illuminates

109
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:51,063
seeing the ignition light
come on during approach

110
00:06:51,063 --> 00:06:52,663
would typically raise a concern

111
00:06:53,859 --> 00:06:58,382
if combustion is interrupted for any
reason is what pilots call a flameout

112
00:06:59,783 --> 00:07:00,783
or an engine failure

113
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:03,879
not sure what's going on with it

114
00:07:05,141 --> 00:07:07,141
if there is an engine failure

115
00:07:07,143 --> 00:07:09,224
the pilots need to
reconsider landing

116
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,280
the pilot would have to make the
decision weather to continue the approach

117
00:07:13,621 --> 00:07:15,121
or abort the approach

118
00:07:15,622 --> 00:07:16,622
see what the problem is

119
00:07:18,184 --> 00:07:20,740
what do you want me to do?
are you going to continue?

120
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,300
okay
yeah

121
00:07:22,461 --> 00:07:24,301
I'm gonna continue
just back me up

122
00:07:25,823 --> 00:07:27,823
captain Hillis decides to land

123
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,740
all right

124
00:07:31,302 --> 00:07:32,302
let's go
missed approach

125
00:07:33,582 --> 00:07:34,582
but then

126
00:07:34,862 --> 00:07:36,542
he reverses his decision

127
00:07:37,946 --> 00:07:39,946
a go around or a missed approach

128
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,742
would have given the pilot more
time to run an engine failure check list

129
00:07:46,145 --> 00:07:50,062
when you're on final you really don't
have that much time to complete it

130
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:53,541
set max power

131
00:07:55,943 --> 00:08:00,207
now at 1500 feet
captain Hillis aborts the landing

132
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,300
when you have an engine failure

133
00:08:03,421 --> 00:08:05,702
you're not only lost
half of your power

134
00:08:06,262 --> 00:08:08,584
you lose 80 percent
of your performance

135
00:08:11,226 --> 00:08:13,326
flight 3379 isn't climbing

136
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:16,619
and it's losing speed

137
00:08:23,065 --> 00:08:24,065
at 1400 feet

138
00:08:25,628 --> 00:08:27,028
the plane stalling

139
00:08:29,219 --> 00:08:30,699
have you got it?
yeah

140
00:08:31,782 --> 00:08:33,282
they're unable to climb

141
00:08:33,742 --> 00:08:36,804
they're starting to lose
directional control of the aircraft

142
00:08:38,826 --> 00:08:41,949
flight 3379 is turning
steadily to the left

143
00:08:42,508 --> 00:08:44,508
veering further off course

144
00:08:47,341 --> 00:08:50,423
things are getting bad real fast
and they're running out of time

145
00:08:52,145 --> 00:08:53,145
here

146
00:08:54,426 --> 00:08:56,326
plunging rapidly
towards the ground

147
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:58,828
the pilots fight to
recover their plane

148
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,621
there's no flight
attendant on the plane

149
00:09:02,222 --> 00:09:03,822
there is a lot of commotion

150
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,460
and you could hear

151
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,220
some kind of warning siren

152
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,265
I was scared
people were scared

153
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,990
we knew we were crashing, I knew

154
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:17,019
we were going down

155
00:09:23,908 --> 00:09:24,908
I just brace myself

156
00:09:26,819 --> 00:09:30,906
literally putting my hand and
my foot on the seat in front of me

157
00:09:37,504 --> 00:09:38,904
I had a moment that

158
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,740
okay I need to survive
I need to live through this

159
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:01,699
when we crashed

160
00:10:02,704 --> 00:10:04,724
I just remember
hitting the ground

161
00:10:04,942 --> 00:10:06,342
very very fast very hard

162
00:10:08,345 --> 00:10:13,130
flight 3379 has just plowed through
the dense wood of north Carolina

163
00:10:14,542 --> 00:10:16,501
it's now a pile of
burning wreckage

164
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:23,602
the plane split literally in between
my seat and the seat in front of me

165
00:10:26,386 --> 00:10:28,384
I can remember
taking my seat belt off

166
00:10:29,182 --> 00:10:31,322
and hearing people moaning
people screaming

167
00:10:33,705 --> 00:10:35,105
I couldn't see anything

168
00:10:36,548 --> 00:10:38,460
I don't know if I
lost my contacts

169
00:10:38,502 --> 00:10:40,502
or I just had fuel in my eyes

170
00:10:43,024 --> 00:10:44,424
I couldn't walk

171
00:10:46,383 --> 00:10:47,383
but

172
00:10:47,545 --> 00:10:49,045
my adrenaline was pumping

173
00:10:49,542 --> 00:10:51,065
I was in fight and flight mode

174
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:54,159
my intuition was
that I had to survive

175
00:10:55,503 --> 00:10:57,922
and somehow I got
away from the fire

176
00:11:09,267 --> 00:11:12,767
Morrisville firefighter David Farrel
is one of the first responders on site

177
00:11:15,665 --> 00:11:17,665
when your heart racing
I mean

178
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,625
you know you're
probably encounter

179
00:11:21,902 --> 00:11:24,403
on the worst things
you've ever been in your life

180
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,899
you could see the fire

181
00:11:28,381 --> 00:11:29,981
your heart was in your throat

182
00:11:30,061 --> 00:11:32,061
your adrenaline was pumping
you're scared

183
00:11:32,903 --> 00:11:34,903
as I got closer to the scene

184
00:11:35,746 --> 00:11:37,266
someone call me out

185
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:39,299
and I look down

186
00:11:45,345 --> 00:11:46,345
I saw a female

187
00:11:47,019 --> 00:11:49,019
pulling herself
away from the fire

188
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,542
and she couldn't move her legs

189
00:11:54,905 --> 00:11:57,705
he had asked my
name and I told him

190
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,662
I needed to find my suitcase
and then I needed to get home

191
00:12:02,584 --> 00:12:04,684
that's it you
you're gonna make it

192
00:12:06,819 --> 00:12:08,819
you're not going
down on my watch

193
00:12:10,781 --> 00:12:13,843
you threw the worse of this,
we're going to get you out of here

194
00:12:16,099 --> 00:12:18,681
Lauren Anderson is
one of only five survivals

195
00:12:19,222 --> 00:12:20,822
50 others are killed

196
00:12:23,461 --> 00:12:24,961
I did break bones in my hand

197
00:12:26,302 --> 00:12:27,802
my clavicle

198
00:12:28,303 --> 00:12:30,303
broke my ribs
puncture my lungs

199
00:12:30,859 --> 00:12:32,859
I've broken dislocated my back

200
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,993
tibia, fibula
break in my left leg

201
00:12:37,343 --> 00:12:38,843
bounce my ankle

202
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:47,220
Captain Michael Hillis and First Officer
Matthew Sailor are among the dead

203
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:54,260
national transportation safety board
investigators are on site by morning

204
00:12:59,303 --> 00:13:01,303
anyone find the data recorders?

205
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,380
team is still looking

206
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,601
the weather wasn't
great last night

207
00:13:06,062 --> 00:13:07,662
now we need the
pilot's record device

208
00:13:09,099 --> 00:13:10,099
and weather data

209
00:13:12,782 --> 00:13:15,620
in this particular accident, icing
was very paramount because

210
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:20,384
3379 was the second
accident for American eagle

211
00:13:20,944 --> 00:13:21,944
just a few weeks past

212
00:13:22,338 --> 00:13:25,742
we'd had another jet stream
involved with icing conditions

213
00:13:27,983 --> 00:13:33,022
was icing the reason flight 3379
failed to make it to the airport?

214
00:13:33,582 --> 00:13:34,582
just 4 miles away

215
00:13:38,659 --> 00:13:39,659
landing gear is down

216
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,840
do you know how
the flaps was set?

217
00:13:52,662 --> 00:13:54,602
I'll check with the
guy in the cockpit

218
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,920
stretch here

219
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:57,981
what can you tell us
about the flaps selector?

220
00:13:59,302 --> 00:14:02,039
the cockpit section was
particularly damaged

221
00:14:03,219 --> 00:14:06,220
a lot of controls on the instruments
were unable to document

222
00:14:07,701 --> 00:14:10,281
the flaps like are used
in 20 degree position

223
00:14:10,819 --> 00:14:11,819
copy that

224
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:16,062
the flap extension was
also very interesting because

225
00:14:16,624 --> 00:14:18,824
it was in the
landing configuration

226
00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:21,019
thank you very much

227
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,643
the plane was iced
up as they were landing

228
00:14:25,703 --> 00:14:26,703
and that's trouble

229
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,383
we had to start
making major inquiries

230
00:14:30,501 --> 00:14:33,401
into the possibility of
an icing involvement

231
00:14:34,185 --> 00:14:37,280
these are pilot reports from 5
other planes flying into Raleigh

232
00:14:39,781 --> 00:14:41,683
we do a pilot's
reporting light icing

233
00:14:42,344 --> 00:14:43,344
but

234
00:14:43,459 --> 00:14:45,459
just traced at high altitudes

235
00:14:46,866 --> 00:14:50,158
investigators learned that the other
pilots flying near Raleigh–Durham

236
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,880
weren't reporting any
significant issues with icing

237
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,302
the icing although it
was present in the area

238
00:14:57,582 --> 00:15:01,261
was absolutely no factor
in the accident investigation

239
00:15:03,782 --> 00:15:04,782
they're all set to land

240
00:15:06,259 --> 00:15:07,259
so what went wrong

241
00:15:10,223 --> 00:15:11,823
maybe they had engine trouble

242
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:16,581
the investigators had
done major challenge

243
00:15:16,621 --> 00:15:20,860
try to figured out if one of the
engines had malfunctioned in some way

244
00:15:21,701 --> 00:15:23,742
can you bring that
blade over here, please?

245
00:15:25,939 --> 00:15:26,939
thank you
thank you sir

246
00:15:30,181 --> 00:15:32,202
now is this blade
from left propeller?

247
00:15:32,823 --> 00:15:34,723
yes, this is from
the right propeller

248
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,440
the team examines the propellers

249
00:15:38,742 --> 00:15:40,742
for an indication that
they were rotating

250
00:15:45,742 --> 00:15:47,083
the way the blade is damaged

251
00:15:47,182 --> 00:15:48,182
provides a clue

252
00:15:50,025 --> 00:15:52,739
if you've got turning
propellers on your airplane

253
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,423
they tend to grab into
things and bend forward

254
00:15:57,264 --> 00:15:59,997
as they hit the debris
of trees and so on

255
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,260
it appears the engines
were rotating full power

256
00:16:05,704 --> 00:16:07,198
so it's 4 miles from the airport

257
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:08,699
it's configured to land

258
00:16:11,903 --> 00:16:12,903
what happened?

259
00:16:14,945 --> 00:16:19,182
as we spent more time
on site with 3379 wreckage

260
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,621
the questions just kept coming

261
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,083
it made it very clear that

262
00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:26,400
this accident was
gonna be a real puzzler

263
00:16:32,981 --> 00:16:35,022
were pilots reporting any
problem during approach?

264
00:16:35,543 --> 00:16:36,543
let me look

265
00:16:38,346 --> 00:16:43,346
NTSB investigators hope the pilots
conversations with air traffic controllers

266
00:16:43,381 --> 00:16:47,064
can shed some light on
why flight 3379 crashed

267
00:16:47,624 --> 00:16:49,719
before reaching
Raleigh–Durham Airport

268
00:16:51,581 --> 00:16:53,663
they're the last people
to talk to the crew

269
00:16:54,143 --> 00:16:56,726
and we wanna know if
there was anything unusual

270
00:16:57,235 --> 00:16:58,235
in their conversations

271
00:17:00,022 --> 00:17:02,161
no there wasn't anything
out of the ordinary

272
00:17:04,544 --> 00:17:05,544
eagle flight 3379

273
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:10,182
reduce to 170 then
descent and maintain 3000

274
00:17:12,181 --> 00:17:17,504
the controller tells investigators that
flight 3379 approach seem routine

275
00:17:19,179 --> 00:17:21,640
170 then 3000
3379

276
00:17:24,262 --> 00:17:26,664
was there any conflicting
traffic as they were coming in?

277
00:17:26,738 --> 00:17:27,738
well
yes

278
00:17:30,143 --> 00:17:32,682
there was a 727 landing
right ahead of them

279
00:17:33,223 --> 00:17:35,279
I warned them about
wake turbulence

280
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,980
eagle flight 3379
caution wake turbulence

281
00:17:39,062 --> 00:17:40,662
you're spacing on a 727

282
00:17:41,023 --> 00:17:42,023
turn left 190

283
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,420
the wake turbulence
issue is particularly critical

284
00:17:46,981 --> 00:17:49,581
this would be a factor that
we're gonna have to deal with

285
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:51,059
thank you very much

286
00:17:55,984 --> 00:17:57,984
how fast does a
wake vortex descent?

287
00:18:00,186 --> 00:18:01,586
300 feet per minute

288
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:07,263
investigators compare
the flight path of flight 3379

289
00:18:07,823 --> 00:18:10,263
with the estimated
path of the wake vortex

290
00:18:10,945 --> 00:18:11,945
all right

291
00:18:12,651 --> 00:18:13,651
let's see what we got

292
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,603
they used recorded radar
returns for both planes

293
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,640
and factoring the weather
at the time of the accident

294
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:26,679
looks like flight 3379 missed it

295
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,220
above more than 600 feet

296
00:18:30,904 --> 00:18:34,259
the jet stream did not fly
throw any of those vortexes

297
00:18:35,141 --> 00:18:39,143
wake turbulence did not affect
the flight path of the accident aircraft

298
00:18:42,468 --> 00:18:46,500
but the radar data reveals that
something happened along the flight path

299
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:51,662
kind of severe off course
after missing the wake vortexes

300
00:18:52,943 --> 00:18:54,959
he's off to the left
why?

301
00:18:56,579 --> 00:18:57,579
why is this aircraft

302
00:18:58,821 --> 00:19:02,109
over here to the left of
the final approach path

303
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:03,702
configured to land?

304
00:19:04,745 --> 00:19:05,745
okay

305
00:19:05,883 --> 00:19:07,950
can you do the descent
checklist please?

306
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,220
the team turn to the
cockpit voice recorder

307
00:19:11,502 --> 00:19:13,524
hoping they might
find an explanation

308
00:19:13,745 --> 00:19:15,245
for the unusual left turn

309
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,540
we were gonna
really have to look at

310
00:19:19,722 --> 00:19:21,542
what was going on
on the flight deck

311
00:19:21,899 --> 00:19:22,899
with the cockpit crew

312
00:19:22,941 --> 00:19:25,021
what were they saying
what were their intentions

313
00:19:25,741 --> 00:19:26,741
altimeter 3031

314
00:19:27,743 --> 00:19:29,023
set
cross checked

315
00:19:29,465 --> 00:19:31,265
pressurization
set and checked

316
00:19:32,306 --> 00:19:33,806
ice protection is on

317
00:19:34,859 --> 00:19:37,659
investigators hear the
captain and first officer

318
00:19:37,702 --> 00:19:40,102
planning the
approach with precision

319
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:41,263
okay
reviewed

320
00:19:42,818 --> 00:19:44,318
so far so good

321
00:19:45,942 --> 00:19:48,742
the flight crew seems to
be working in perfect tandem

322
00:19:48,743 --> 00:19:51,443
as flight 3379
approaches the airport

323
00:19:54,241 --> 00:19:55,841
why is that ignition light on?

324
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,578
did we just have a flame out?

325
00:19:59,621 --> 00:20:00,921
did he just say flame out?

326
00:20:03,543 --> 00:20:05,543
did we just have a flame out?

327
00:20:07,221 --> 00:20:09,582
when the captain talks
about the ignition flight

328
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:10,741
that

329
00:20:11,303 --> 00:20:13,023
all of a sudden
that came out of no where

330
00:20:15,546 --> 00:20:16,546
we had a flame out

331
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,660
we lost the left one?

332
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,180
yeah

333
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:24,899
they discover that the
ignition light illuminated

334
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,660
moments before the crash

335
00:20:29,342 --> 00:20:32,658
this ignition light introduce
the thought of the lost engine

336
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:35,821
considering the physical
evidence we've seen

337
00:20:36,142 --> 00:20:38,142
this idea was very strange

338
00:20:39,264 --> 00:20:44,361
you would expect during that period that
there would be some sort of confirmation

339
00:20:45,182 --> 00:20:47,703
nothing happened
other than absolute quite

340
00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:52,661
we needed to try and
figure out what was going on

341
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:01,240
this is the engine sound waves
from when the ignition light is on

342
00:21:02,582 --> 00:21:06,284
another way for investigators to
determine if the engines were operating

343
00:21:06,505 --> 00:21:09,700
is to analyze their sound on
the cockpit voice recording

344
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:15,300
this study is attempting to home
in on blade passing frequencies

345
00:21:16,061 --> 00:21:17,761
blade passing meaning

346
00:21:18,301 --> 00:21:21,419
all these revolutions
of the propeller

347
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:25,182
conflict comparison

348
00:21:27,303 --> 00:21:30,881
they compare the engine
sounds from flight 3379

349
00:21:31,261 --> 00:21:33,663
to other engines
operating at 100 percent

350
00:21:35,619 --> 00:21:38,319
we were looking at the acoustics
of the engine performance

351
00:21:38,461 --> 00:21:42,979
and it's relatively easy to match that
against the acoustics of a working engine

352
00:21:45,502 --> 00:21:47,202
literally almost identical

353
00:21:48,903 --> 00:21:52,960
investigators hear evidence that
both engines were running at full speed

354
00:21:55,382 --> 00:21:58,820
the sound analysis told us the
sound generated by the engines

355
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,762
on this aircraft were consistent
with two engines generating power

356
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:05,723
the ignition light
must've misled the pilots

357
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,340
in believing the left
engine flamed out

358
00:22:08,621 --> 00:22:10,121
but really
it hadn't

359
00:22:14,219 --> 00:22:18,998
this sound analysis put the
idea of an engine failure to bed

360
00:22:19,035 --> 00:22:21,035
it just wasn't a
factor in the accident

361
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,480
this discovery leaves
investigators puzzled

362
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:30,141
why was that ignition light on if there
was nothing wrong with the engine?

363
00:22:36,379 --> 00:22:38,379
why is that ignition light on?

364
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,660
did we just have a flame out?

365
00:22:41,223 --> 00:22:43,823
investigators examine
jet stream manuals

366
00:22:44,544 --> 00:22:47,100
to determine why an
ignition light would come on

367
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:51,023
even though the plane
engines were fully operational

368
00:22:53,864 --> 00:22:54,864
so why activated?

369
00:22:58,939 --> 00:23:01,139
it's wired to negative
torque system

370
00:23:02,862 --> 00:23:04,203
negative torque occurs

371
00:23:04,264 --> 00:23:08,164
when the air loads on the propellers
cause then to drive the engines

372
00:23:08,185 --> 00:23:10,467
instead of the engines
driving the propellers

373
00:23:11,028 --> 00:23:13,028
it can be a sign of a flame out

374
00:23:14,342 --> 00:23:15,862
the same scenario
you would have is

375
00:23:16,623 --> 00:23:19,923
when you put your car in
low gear going down a hill

376
00:23:19,979 --> 00:23:21,979
and use the transmission to drag

377
00:23:23,384 --> 00:23:25,384
says the ignition
light will activate

378
00:23:26,465 --> 00:23:28,485
they advance the
propeller speed too quickly

379
00:23:29,588 --> 00:23:31,188
there is a situation when

380
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:34,980
you would be in a low power
setting on your torque and

381
00:23:35,222 --> 00:23:37,578
as you go speeds high
in preparation for landing

382
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,780
if you move those speed
levers up too quickly

383
00:23:42,062 --> 00:23:45,740
that can trigger the negative
torque to cause that light to come on

384
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:49,458
go ahead

385
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:50,980
flaps 10

386
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,100
investigators return to the CVR

387
00:23:54,223 --> 00:23:57,225
to learn if the pilots mention
increasing the propeller speed

388
00:23:59,498 --> 00:24:01,498
let's go ahead and go speed type

389
00:24:03,182 --> 00:24:07,939
they hear captain Hillis advancing the
propellers to a 100 percent for landing

390
00:24:08,819 --> 00:24:10,819
why is that ignition light on?

391
00:24:13,339 --> 00:24:14,339
there it is

392
00:24:15,061 --> 00:24:17,121
advance the propeller
speed and boom

393
00:24:17,262 --> 00:24:19,062
the ignition light illuminates

394
00:24:21,505 --> 00:24:25,129
the team discovers that the
pilots created negative torque

395
00:24:27,434 --> 00:24:30,460
negative torque doesn't necessary
mean there was an engine failure

396
00:24:31,382 --> 00:24:34,623
you would get a transient
situation for a second or two

397
00:24:35,063 --> 00:24:37,063
that could trigger
that light to come on

398
00:24:38,178 --> 00:24:39,178
we had a flame out

399
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,700
he missed diagnoses
the situation

400
00:24:43,663 --> 00:24:45,763
surely he checks engines' rpm

401
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,119
what do you want me to do?

402
00:24:49,206 --> 00:24:50,206
are you gonna continue?

403
00:24:51,188 --> 00:24:52,188
okay
yeah

404
00:24:52,618 --> 00:24:54,058
I'm gonna continue

405
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,340
just back me up

406
00:24:57,462 --> 00:25:00,162
he's not even checking to see
if there is an actual engine failure

407
00:25:01,339 --> 00:25:02,339
look at your instruments

408
00:25:02,621 --> 00:25:05,582
determine whether or not the
both engines are generating power

409
00:25:06,543 --> 00:25:09,043
it's not that hard
they're trained for that

410
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,380
100 percent full power

411
00:25:16,863 --> 00:25:19,085
if you don't know if you
have an engine failure

412
00:25:19,379 --> 00:25:21,580
but you're responding to
a potential engine failure

413
00:25:22,181 --> 00:25:23,181
that's not very good

414
00:25:23,282 --> 00:25:25,322
and that could very
easily cause an accident

415
00:25:26,063 --> 00:25:27,563
let's go
miss approach

416
00:25:28,905 --> 00:25:32,301
so what actions did the pilots
take during the missed approach?

417
00:25:35,062 --> 00:25:37,823
okay so how did they configure
the plane for missed approach?

418
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,420
set engine power max

419
00:25:42,982 --> 00:25:43,982
set max power

420
00:25:48,701 --> 00:25:50,401
as they should have
what else?

421
00:25:53,223 --> 00:25:56,745
it's not mention reducing the
flaps to 10 or retracting landing gear

422
00:25:59,062 --> 00:26:03,024
a go around would be done
by informing the other pilot then

423
00:26:03,584 --> 00:26:05,084
applying max power

424
00:26:05,588 --> 00:26:08,000
retract the gear
retract the flaps

425
00:26:10,662 --> 00:26:13,963
but the pilot's failure to raise
the gear or retract the flaps

426
00:26:14,585 --> 00:26:16,585
doesn't explain the accident

427
00:26:17,126 --> 00:26:20,126
how does that configuration cause
the plane to veer left and crashed?

428
00:26:21,221 --> 00:26:23,221
well there is only
one way to find out

429
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:32,022
there was a necessity
to conduct a flight test

430
00:26:32,142 --> 00:26:35,599
because we really wanted to figure
out what the crew had introduced

431
00:26:35,785 --> 00:26:36,785
in the configuration

432
00:26:37,252 --> 00:26:40,962
that would make the aircraft
deviate from this intended flight path

433
00:26:42,342 --> 00:26:43,342
okay let's go max power

434
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:47,686
investigators turn
to test pilots for help

435
00:26:48,018 --> 00:26:51,518
they'll take a jet-stream
3201 to its limit

436
00:26:51,701 --> 00:26:53,301
to try to solve the mystery

437
00:26:53,662 --> 00:26:57,199
sometimes you have to put
yourself in an uncomfortable position

438
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:00,482
and you know what's gonna
happen if you go too far

439
00:27:01,302 --> 00:27:02,302
max power

440
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:03,663
flaps at 20

441
00:27:04,585 --> 00:27:08,560
they start by duplicating the configuration
the pilots had set for the missed approach

442
00:27:09,341 --> 00:27:11,141
flaps 20
gear down

443
00:27:14,355 --> 00:27:16,355
good
gear down

444
00:27:22,465 --> 00:27:26,658
okay it's slower than a regular
missed approach but still doable

445
00:27:27,259 --> 00:27:31,764
so why did fly 3379 turn
to the left and crashed?

446
00:27:33,703 --> 00:27:35,703
let's do the same
configuration but

447
00:27:35,706 --> 00:27:38,226
put max power on the
right engine but not the left

448
00:27:38,779 --> 00:27:39,779
roger that

449
00:27:43,422 --> 00:27:45,422
they try a different
configuration

450
00:27:45,675 --> 00:27:48,179
in the hope of recreating
the pilot's actions

451
00:27:50,142 --> 00:27:51,142
max power
right engine

452
00:28:01,062 --> 00:28:02,562
I can't climb like this

453
00:28:08,701 --> 00:28:13,225
investigators finally understand how
captain hillis executed the missed approach

454
00:28:14,345 --> 00:28:15,345
set max power

455
00:28:17,699 --> 00:28:19,699
believing his left
engine has failed

456
00:28:19,941 --> 00:28:22,522
the captain increases
power only to the right engine

457
00:28:31,984 --> 00:28:35,988
the imbalance in engine power robs the
plane of the airspeed it needs to climb out

458
00:28:36,498 --> 00:28:39,098
with the gear down
and the flaps extended

459
00:28:46,301 --> 00:28:49,301
the flight test told us an
airplane with that configuration

460
00:28:49,384 --> 00:28:51,384
could not have
been fallen safely

461
00:28:51,667 --> 00:28:52,867
it had to crash

462
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,186
investigators conclude

463
00:29:01,265 --> 00:29:06,001
that the captain didn't configure his
plane correctly for a missed approach

464
00:29:07,219 --> 00:29:09,040
if the captain thought
one of his engines fail

465
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,562
they should have performed
single engine missed approach

466
00:29:13,784 --> 00:29:15,784
they didn't do that either

467
00:29:16,618 --> 00:29:19,800
so he set himself up for
a nearly unflyable airplane

468
00:29:22,904 --> 00:29:23,904
you got it

469
00:29:23,985 --> 00:29:24,985
yeah

470
00:29:25,666 --> 00:29:30,668
NTSB investigators focus
squarely on the captain of flight 3379

471
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,990
29 year old
Michael Hillis

472
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:39,144
to come across an accident where response
was botched as thoroughly as this one

473
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:41,744
it begs the question:
how did he get there?

474
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,620
he's got 2,294 turboprops

475
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,900
3,499 total flying hours

476
00:29:59,906 --> 00:30:05,221
NTSB investigators scrutinize the personnel
records of the pilots of flight 3379

477
00:30:07,142 --> 00:30:09,742
we want to find out the
background of the pilots

478
00:30:10,182 --> 00:30:12,382
is there anything in their
performance that can reveal

479
00:30:12,475 --> 00:30:14,542
something about
their performance

480
00:30:14,601 --> 00:30:16,468
in the night of the accident

481
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:18,782
from American eagle files

482
00:30:18,782 --> 00:30:20,199
the team learns

483
00:30:20,223 --> 00:30:24,511
that Michael Hillis was licensed
to fly multiple turboprop airplanes

484
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,480
in march 1991

485
00:30:29,739 --> 00:30:31,839
we've got single engine
missed approaches today

486
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,400
are you ready for that?

487
00:30:33,401 --> 00:30:34,401
yes sir

488
00:30:35,102 --> 00:30:38,504
investigators dig deeper
into captain hillis's pilot records

489
00:30:41,219 --> 00:30:42,219
right

490
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,300
I'm cutting your left engine

491
00:30:46,543 --> 00:30:48,543
we like to see an
airman with airmanship

492
00:30:49,541 --> 00:30:51,541
so we had to look back
at the training information

493
00:30:55,344 --> 00:30:56,344
look this

494
00:30:58,098 --> 00:30:59,098
trainers evaluation

495
00:31:01,461 --> 00:31:04,563
okay you're losing airspeed that you're
gonna need how do you get it back?

496
00:31:05,698 --> 00:31:06,698
not sure

497
00:31:08,941 --> 00:31:09,941
this is telling

498
00:31:10,383 --> 00:31:12,624
he's messing up single
engine missed approaches

499
00:31:13,784 --> 00:31:18,384
it was very obvious that this captain
was having serious troubles with his

500
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,580
airmanship development

501
00:31:20,862 --> 00:31:22,862
single engine missed approaches
engine failures

502
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,660
when is this?

503
00:31:27,621 --> 00:31:28,621
April 1992

504
00:31:29,542 --> 00:31:31,562
that was two years
before the accident

505
00:31:32,105 --> 00:31:34,205
it's more than enough
time to improve

506
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,160
he makes captain
a few month later

507
00:31:38,783 --> 00:31:41,583
by the time pilots
become airline pilots

508
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,900
they're pretty good

509
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,240
the selection
process is so rigorous

510
00:31:45,302 --> 00:31:47,202
that you don't get
to be an airline pilot

511
00:31:47,263 --> 00:31:49,463
unless you have
considerable capabilities

512
00:31:51,781 --> 00:31:52,781
it's all have here

513
00:31:54,583 --> 00:31:57,583
of any American eagle pilots
we'll talk about them

514
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,260
let's find out

515
00:32:00,541 --> 00:32:03,621
the NTSB wants to know
more about Hillis's career

516
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:07,764
usually in the pilot file
there will be some notes

517
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:13,223
about the issues that have been encountered
by other persons flying with the captain

518
00:32:14,625 --> 00:32:17,025
what can you tell me
about Michael Hillis?

519
00:32:18,581 --> 00:32:20,581
we're pretty
broken up about this

520
00:32:21,418 --> 00:32:24,980
investigators track down American
eagle Raleigh–Durham base manager

521
00:32:26,342 --> 00:32:29,481
unfortunately we have a lot
of complains about his flying

522
00:32:30,261 --> 00:32:33,279
I was really surprise
to hear him say that

523
00:32:33,621 --> 00:32:34,621
complains

524
00:32:37,418 --> 00:32:40,160
several first officers that
flew with him at Raleigh

525
00:32:41,142 --> 00:32:44,162
co-pilots were whispering
to their colleagues

526
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,304
it was something not normal

527
00:32:46,305 --> 00:32:48,899
and we had co-pilots that
were afraid to fly with him

528
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,280
and keep a close eye
on what he was doing

529
00:32:52,062 --> 00:32:53,062
really

530
00:32:53,903 --> 00:32:56,703
if pilots are afraid
to fly with this guy

531
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:59,381
which is essentially what
the base manager told us

532
00:33:00,342 --> 00:33:02,342
that's very revealing
about the accident

533
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,300
thanks a lot

534
00:33:10,143 --> 00:33:13,183
hate to say it but this is
a really questionable pilot

535
00:33:16,059 --> 00:33:19,019
we got a picture of a
pilot who could fly okay

536
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:21,683
but when he was faced
with something unexpected

537
00:33:22,103 --> 00:33:24,603
his performance
would start deteriorating

538
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:29,740
how this guy end
up at American Eagle?

539
00:33:29,981 --> 00:33:30,981
where are their final?

540
00:33:31,702 --> 00:33:33,702
application should be on file

541
00:33:35,386 --> 00:33:37,686
we try to get as much
information as we can

542
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,820
for complete pilots history

543
00:33:41,782 --> 00:33:43,982
his previous job was with Comair

544
00:33:44,905 --> 00:33:48,466
captain hillis applied to work
for American eagle in Oct 1919

545
00:33:49,299 --> 00:33:51,399
while he was flying
for another airline

546
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:56,464
finer if did a background
check this guy

547
00:34:02,821 --> 00:34:06,925
when investigators ask American eagle
about background checks on Michael Hillis

548
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,900
they shocked by what they learned

549
00:34:11,542 --> 00:34:15,084
they did not go back and
check with previous employers

550
00:34:16,584 --> 00:34:19,680
the NTSB does what
American eagle never did

551
00:34:20,262 --> 00:34:22,662
they requisition Michael
Hillis' file from Comair

552
00:34:24,674 --> 00:34:28,174
when we compared his records of
comair with his records at American eagle

553
00:34:28,302 --> 00:34:29,902
they were consistent

554
00:34:30,583 --> 00:34:31,583
moody
unpredictable

555
00:34:32,023 --> 00:34:33,023
gets distracted

556
00:34:34,026 --> 00:34:37,046
concerns about tunnel vision
in an emergency situation

557
00:34:40,222 --> 00:34:42,222
and he was potentially
a dangerous pilot

558
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,884
tunnel vision in
emergency situation

559
00:34:46,705 --> 00:34:47,705
comair considered

560
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:49,919
this guy wanted him fired

561
00:34:54,063 --> 00:34:56,063
it just keeps getting worse

562
00:34:56,586 --> 00:34:58,486
I've never encountered
before since

563
00:34:58,579 --> 00:35:00,979
a pilot who was
recommended to be terminated

564
00:35:00,981 --> 00:35:03,181
because he was
potentially unsafe

565
00:35:03,902 --> 00:35:06,402
comair recommended for dismissal

566
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,700
did they fired him?

567
00:35:11,261 --> 00:35:13,842
he resigns from comair
before they can fire

568
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:16,920
that captain should not
have been flying passengers

569
00:35:17,781 --> 00:35:18,781
under any circumstances

570
00:35:22,024 --> 00:35:25,040
did the American eagle know
about this guy performance history?

571
00:35:25,821 --> 00:35:27,821
it didn't look like they asked

572
00:35:29,784 --> 00:35:31,784
no record of comair
providing to American eagle

573
00:35:34,021 --> 00:35:36,021
but the picture is crystal clear

574
00:35:36,862 --> 00:35:40,920
Michael Hillis' flying career was
blemished by failed certification test

575
00:35:41,662 --> 00:35:43,662
bad evaluations from trainers

576
00:35:44,182 --> 00:35:47,724
and complains from colleges that
will never passed on to American eagle

577
00:35:48,386 --> 00:35:50,886
one would have to ask
themselves if you really knew

578
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,600
the background of this pilot

579
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:55,120
would you put your wife
or your child in that aircraft?

580
00:35:56,023 --> 00:35:58,023
and the answer would be no

581
00:35:58,584 --> 00:36:02,767
but there were two pilots
in the cockpit of flight 3379

582
00:36:08,904 --> 00:36:09,904
in this case

583
00:36:10,065 --> 00:36:13,667
the ability of first officer to recognize
that the captain skills were deficient

584
00:36:13,748 --> 00:36:15,248
it took a long time

585
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,541
did the first officer know
who he is flying with?

586
00:36:22,184 --> 00:36:23,184
here

587
00:36:23,304 --> 00:36:24,404
investigators wonder

588
00:36:24,465 --> 00:36:28,625
if first officer sailor knew he
was team with an unreliable pilot?

589
00:36:28,941 --> 00:36:29,941
no

590
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,923
First Officer Matthew Sailor
25 years old

591
00:36:38,544 --> 00:36:41,265
work for American eagle
for a year before the crash

592
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:46,780
the NTSB looks into the work
schedules of first officer sailor

593
00:36:46,782 --> 00:36:48,782
and captain hillis

594
00:36:49,464 --> 00:36:51,464
have they flown with us before?

595
00:36:55,903 --> 00:36:57,503
no
not once

596
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,903
they discover the first officer
was knew to this particular route

597
00:37:02,943 --> 00:37:04,443
so was he based at Raleigh?

598
00:37:05,504 --> 00:37:06,504
no

599
00:37:06,907 --> 00:37:08,407
he work out of Miami

600
00:37:10,221 --> 00:37:12,221
I think it was critical
to this accident

601
00:37:12,742 --> 00:37:15,900
that the first officer was from a
different base than the captain

602
00:37:17,782 --> 00:37:21,040
first officer in Raleigh–Durham
need to keep a close eye on him but

603
00:37:21,179 --> 00:37:22,179
he's out of Miami

604
00:37:23,681 --> 00:37:26,081
this guy had no idea
who he was flying with

605
00:37:30,421 --> 00:37:32,421
let's go ahead and go speed type

606
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:38,966
when first officer sailor joins captain
hillis in the cockpit on Dec 13 1994

607
00:37:39,987 --> 00:37:43,121
he has no idea what
type of pilot he's team with

608
00:37:44,501 --> 00:37:47,260
this pilot should've never been
a pilot and command that aircraft

609
00:37:49,262 --> 00:37:52,762
as flight 3379 is on final
approach for Raleigh–Durham

610
00:37:53,784 --> 00:37:55,784
captain hillis is
caught by surprise

611
00:37:56,179 --> 00:37:59,241
he missed interpret's the
illumination of an ignition light

612
00:38:00,983 --> 00:38:02,883
why is that ignition light on?

613
00:38:03,265 --> 00:38:05,065
did we just have a flame out?

614
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:07,360
not sure what's going on with it

615
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,101
we had a flame out

616
00:38:10,383 --> 00:38:15,083
captain hillis doesn't realize that by
increasing the propeller speed too quickly

617
00:38:15,141 --> 00:38:18,763
he has created a momentary
negative torque condition

618
00:38:18,783 --> 00:38:20,483
he missed diagnoses
engine failure

619
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:22,140
and responded improperly

620
00:38:23,461 --> 00:38:24,461
I am gonna continue

621
00:38:25,743 --> 00:38:28,985
instead of landing hillis
decides to do a go around

622
00:38:29,426 --> 00:38:31,026
let's go
missed approach

623
00:38:31,707 --> 00:38:33,807
starting with the
captain's misdiagnosis

624
00:38:34,219 --> 00:38:35,719
of an engine failure

625
00:38:35,899 --> 00:38:37,799
and his decision to go around

626
00:38:38,742 --> 00:38:41,442
pretty much was
self-induced engine failure

627
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:45,544
the pilots now face
a severe emergency

628
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,260
the gear was down

629
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,100
it was trying to climb

630
00:38:51,101 --> 00:38:52,141
set max power

631
00:38:54,223 --> 00:38:56,223
it was impossible
in that configuration

632
00:38:57,579 --> 00:39:00,079
they basically about
to go off the edge of cliff

633
00:39:06,266 --> 00:39:09,302
it falls to the first officer
to rectify captain's mistakes

634
00:39:10,421 --> 00:39:11,421
here

635
00:39:13,802 --> 00:39:15,802
I think he could have
saved the airplane

636
00:39:15,899 --> 00:39:17,899
but by the time
he recognize that

637
00:39:18,182 --> 00:39:19,182
it was too late

638
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:32,602
15 people are killed

639
00:39:32,743 --> 00:39:34,243
because of hillis' errors

640
00:39:38,621 --> 00:39:41,823
made every mistake in the book
in the last two minutes of the flight

641
00:39:46,459 --> 00:39:47,459
I had anger

642
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:50,560
sure at that time for
the pilot and the co-pilot

643
00:39:50,623 --> 00:39:53,123
for the errors that they made

644
00:39:53,184 --> 00:39:56,979
ultimately there was more
pointing fingers to the airline

645
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:02,923
if American eagle access documents
about hillis' past before they hire him

646
00:40:03,842 --> 00:40:06,142
he might not have been in
that cockpit on Dec 13 1994

647
00:40:13,019 --> 00:40:15,819
the final takeaway
from 3379 is that

648
00:40:16,382 --> 00:40:18,382
we've gotta identify
those airman

649
00:40:18,903 --> 00:40:21,703
that don't display
airmanship qualities

650
00:40:23,981 --> 00:40:27,539
the crash of flight
3379 reveals deep flaws

651
00:40:27,584 --> 00:40:30,528
in the standard hiring
practices of US airlines

652
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:35,640
background information on pilots
is almost never shared amongst airlines

653
00:40:37,562 --> 00:40:39,562
if I was to apply
for a job somewhere

654
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:42,160
they would check my references

655
00:40:42,342 --> 00:40:43,342
this is a pilot

656
00:40:44,619 --> 00:40:48,219
isn't it important that we find out if
this person is competent enough?

657
00:40:50,178 --> 00:40:51,178
that's for 88

658
00:40:51,861 --> 00:40:52,861
90

659
00:40:54,942 --> 00:40:59,142
tragically the case of flight
3379 is not unprecedented

660
00:41:00,262 --> 00:41:01,262
again 93

661
00:41:02,539 --> 00:41:04,339
in three previous accidents

662
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:07,740
the NTSB recommended that
records from previous employers

663
00:41:07,742 --> 00:41:10,042
be made available to a
pilot's current employer

664
00:41:13,342 --> 00:41:14,342
four times job

665
00:41:17,586 --> 00:41:19,586
now for the forth time

666
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:22,480
the NTSB recommends
that US airlines conduct

667
00:41:22,621 --> 00:41:25,621
better background checks
on perspective pilots

668
00:41:25,943 --> 00:41:29,343
but still no changes are
made to federal regulations

669
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,760
I felt like I had
to do something

670
00:41:33,822 --> 00:41:37,164
I had to speak for these
15 people that couldn't speak

671
00:41:40,301 --> 00:41:42,801
and I went spoke
in front of congress

672
00:41:44,504 --> 00:41:47,004
in 1996 two years
after the crash

673
00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:50,239
US congress passes the
pilots record information act

674
00:41:50,701 --> 00:41:54,701
to ensure airlines have access to
previous companies pilot records

675
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:59,502
the chances of a pilot falling
through the cracks as this pilot did

676
00:42:00,224 --> 00:42:02,524
have been reduced
because of the legislation

677
00:42:03,618 --> 00:42:05,218
it's unfortunate for
that to happen but

678
00:42:05,259 --> 00:42:07,259
but that's what it took
