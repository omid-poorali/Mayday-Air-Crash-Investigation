00:00:04,381 --> 00:00:05,381
no no no

00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:14,160
security footage of
flight Dubai flight 981

3
00:00:14,701 --> 00:00:16,141
captures its final moments

4
00:00:16,622 --> 00:00:17,622
oh it's diving hard

5
00:00:18,578 --> 00:00:20,740
the level of violence to
the impact was catastrophic

6
00:00:21,702 --> 00:00:24,360
62 people are
killed in the fatal dive

7
00:00:25,021 --> 00:00:28,682
investigators soon discovered
the pilots had aborted two landings

8
00:00:28,983 --> 00:00:30,023
Rostov tower

9
00:00:30,145 --> 00:00:31,585
we're going around

10
00:00:31,659 --> 00:00:34,220
a go around is done just
when conditions are not perfect

11
00:00:34,862 --> 00:00:37,182
did they say why they were
going around the second time?

12
00:00:37,343 --> 00:00:38,943
they just said
going around

13
00:00:39,065 --> 00:00:40,065
check your speed

14
00:00:42,139 --> 00:00:44,842
the next thing I knew the plane
was diving towards the runway

15
00:00:44,982 --> 00:00:48,504
investigators needed to find out
how the two go-arounds were different

16
00:00:49,225 --> 00:00:51,225
one turns to disaster
why?

17
00:01:18,105 --> 00:01:23,082
fly Dubai flight 981 closes in on
Rostov-on-don international airport

18
00:01:23,141 --> 00:01:24,141
in south west Russia

19
00:01:27,664 --> 00:01:28,664
Rostov tower

20
00:01:28,825 --> 00:01:30,825
sky Dubai 981
we're at 2600 feet

21
00:01:32,461 --> 00:01:34,461
2300 feet is our
next target altitude

22
00:01:36,343 --> 00:01:37,343
11 miles out

23
00:01:37,784 --> 00:01:39,884
captain Aristos Sokratous

24
00:01:39,926 --> 00:01:41,926
and first officer
Alejandro Álava Cruz

25
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:45,460
prepare the Boeing
737800 for touch down

26
00:01:48,102 --> 00:01:52,102
both pilots had a pretty good amount
of flying hours in 737 specifically

27
00:01:52,901 --> 00:01:54,834
these were experienced pilots

28
00:01:56,863 --> 00:01:57,863
flight 981
Rostov-tower

29
00:01:59,139 --> 00:02:00,139
winds 240 degrees

30
00:02:01,142 --> 00:02:02,142
gust 30 knots

31
00:02:02,702 --> 00:02:04,382
you're clear to
land on runway 22

32
00:02:06,384 --> 00:02:09,446
the controller reports the
weather conditions at the airport

33
00:02:11,188 --> 00:02:12,828
thick clouds cover Rostov-on-don

34
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,980
high winds are
battering the runways

35
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:18,819
the weather in Rostov
at that time was

36
00:02:20,221 --> 00:02:21,501
pretty low cloud

37
00:02:22,784 --> 00:02:23,784
with wind gusts

38
00:02:24,627 --> 00:02:27,981
it was typical for that
time of year for Rostov

39
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:30,281
if you look at the
geography with the

40
00:02:30,822 --> 00:02:32,422
sea and the hills around it

41
00:02:32,463 --> 00:02:33,463
then yes

42
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,180
you can expect some challenges

43
00:02:35,581 --> 00:02:41,125
fly Dubai flight 981 departed
Dubai international airport at 10:PM

44
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:45,550
it's 4 hour flight north
west to Rostov-on-Don

45
00:02:47,861 --> 00:02:50,441
it's bumpy ride for the
55 passengers on board

46
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,660
the flight is expected
to land in minutes

47
00:02:58,023 --> 00:02:59,023
150 knots

48
00:03:00,185 --> 00:03:02,185
8 miles out
the pilots reduce speed

49
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,760
as they begin the final descent

50
00:03:06,421 --> 00:03:07,421
on approach

51
00:03:07,542 --> 00:03:10,042
pilots know exactly
what the airplane is doing

52
00:03:10,084 --> 00:03:12,084
the know the conditions
that they're flying in

53
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,300
flaps 30

54
00:03:13,741 --> 00:03:14,741
flaps 30

55
00:03:15,181 --> 00:03:17,181
they're going to drop
the flaps bit by bit

56
00:03:17,275 --> 00:03:19,275
when they dropped
their landing gear

57
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,720
it's very gradual process

58
00:03:21,942 --> 00:03:23,942
it should be a bit bumpy
and later should be calm

59
00:03:25,304 --> 00:03:27,304
the pilots expect
turbulence on approach

60
00:03:27,818 --> 00:03:29,318
but anticipate a smooth landing

61
00:03:32,624 --> 00:03:34,324
the runway is just 4 miles away

62
00:03:35,985 --> 00:03:36,985
but there is thread ahead

63
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:38,425
go around

64
00:03:38,867 --> 00:03:40,147
wind-shear ahead

65
00:03:40,578 --> 00:03:43,078
the on-board radar has
detected dangerous winds

66
00:03:44,222 --> 00:03:45,502
wind-shear ahead
wind-shear ahead

67
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:51,160
wind-shear is a rapid change
in direction and speed of wind

68
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:57,107
if a pilot experiences a strong head-wind
that suddenly changes to a tail-wind

69
00:03:57,828 --> 00:04:00,919
the aircraft might not have
enough lift to remain airborne

70
00:04:01,221 --> 00:04:02,721
especially at low altitude

71
00:04:03,782 --> 00:04:06,782
the wind-shear alert is build into
the aircraft's avionics to tell you

72
00:04:07,745 --> 00:04:10,285
going in the wind currents
that could be problematic

73
00:04:11,107 --> 00:04:12,387
wind-shear ahead

74
00:04:12,548 --> 00:04:14,148
wind-shear
go-around

75
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:16,241
just one thousand
feet above the ground

76
00:04:17,022 --> 00:04:19,262
landing at Rostov-on-don
becomes too risky

77
00:04:22,906 --> 00:04:23,906
Rostov tower
this is 981

78
00:04:25,186 --> 00:04:27,418
we're conducting a go-around
due to the wind-shear

79
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,340
the pilots abort their approach

80
00:04:31,982 --> 00:04:35,982
every pilot is prepared to make
a go-around on every approach

81
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,282
it's something that pilots do
off the top of their heads

82
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,141
there's no manual involved

83
00:04:42,663 --> 00:04:44,863
they have a limit the amount
of approaches that can try

84
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:46,519
as long as they
have enough fuels

85
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,620
so why not go-around
and let's try it again

86
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:50,542
flight 981
copy

87
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,818
flight 981 is one of four incoming
flights controllers are managing

88
00:04:57,219 --> 00:04:58,719
as high winds delay landings

89
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:02,541
Aeroflot 1166
be advised

90
00:05:03,028 --> 00:05:05,528
sky Dubai 981 reports
wind-shear on landing

91
00:05:07,222 --> 00:05:08,740
the air traffic
controller's work-flow

92
00:05:08,785 --> 00:05:10,852
was definitely increased
in this environment

93
00:05:10,862 --> 00:05:13,363
and they have to start
juggling all those cards in the air

94
00:05:13,983 --> 00:05:14,983
as flight 981 climbs

95
00:05:17,944 --> 00:05:18,944
Aeroflot 1166

96
00:05:19,505 --> 00:05:21,585
you're clear to
land on runway 22

97
00:05:22,907 --> 00:05:24,907
an Aeroflot flight
prepares to land

98
00:05:29,063 --> 00:05:32,586
captain Sokratous pays close
attention to its communications

99
00:05:33,305 --> 00:05:35,305
I wanna see what
this guy will do

100
00:05:35,862 --> 00:05:38,462
the crew at this point is hoping
that the crews of other's flights

101
00:05:38,544 --> 00:05:41,276
are able to give them some
information that they might be able to use

102
00:05:41,305 --> 00:05:44,172
to make some decision
about what to do next

103
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,670
that flight can't land
at Rostov-on-don either

104
00:05:50,185 --> 00:05:51,185
Aeroflot 1166

105
00:05:51,902 --> 00:05:53,902
we're going-around
due to wind-shear

106
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:58,698
the Aeroflot pilots also encounter
wind-shear on final approach

107
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,000
they're forced to abort

108
00:06:02,023 --> 00:06:03,523
that kind of seals the deal

109
00:06:03,586 --> 00:06:05,286
fly Dubai is gonna
have to either wait

110
00:06:05,306 --> 00:06:08,634
or they're gonna have to
go to an alternative airport

111
00:06:09,464 --> 00:06:10,964
high over Rostov-on-don

112
00:06:11,022 --> 00:06:13,022
passengers on
flight 981 are restless

113
00:06:16,059 --> 00:06:18,059
the pilots are
holding at 15000 feet

114
00:06:18,862 --> 00:06:19,862
circling near the airport

115
00:06:20,332 --> 00:06:22,332
waiting for a chance to land

116
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:27,605
the pilot sit on a holding pattern since
that had enough fuel to be able to do so

117
00:06:27,701 --> 00:06:29,701
to wait for weather
conditions to improve

118
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:32,724
3 other planes are
also in a holding pattern

119
00:06:33,344 --> 00:06:36,202
the storm pounding
Rostov-on-don isn't passing

120
00:06:43,147 --> 00:06:44,147
Aeroflot 1166

121
00:06:45,142 --> 00:06:46,342
we're diverting

122
00:06:49,022 --> 00:06:50,022
sky Dubai 981

123
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,520
for your information

124
00:06:51,543 --> 00:06:54,082
previous flight went
to alternative airport

125
00:06:54,385 --> 00:06:58,364
all the other flights decide to
divert to alternate airport instead

126
00:07:01,585 --> 00:07:06,443
the problem with diverting is that
it's expensive and it's inconvenient

127
00:07:06,941 --> 00:07:08,941
the passengers don't
end up with the destination

128
00:07:09,183 --> 00:07:11,183
they have to be put up in hotels

129
00:07:11,263 --> 00:07:12,263
and

130
00:07:12,304 --> 00:07:13,304
with low-cost airline

131
00:07:13,748 --> 00:07:15,248
it's the last thing it wants

132
00:07:16,299 --> 00:07:19,341
captain Sokratous continues
monitoring the weather radar

133
00:07:19,984 --> 00:07:21,484
finally he spots a clearing

134
00:07:21,946 --> 00:07:23,446
I think I can give it a try

135
00:07:23,908 --> 00:07:25,188
I agree
let's try

136
00:07:26,747 --> 00:07:30,747
it's not unusual for crews to take
advantage if there happens to be

137
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:35,332
breaking the weather pattern that provides
safe conditions to land the aircraft

138
00:07:36,781 --> 00:07:37,821
sky Dubai 981

139
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:40,225
request descent
for another approach

140
00:07:41,142 --> 00:07:42,942
50000 feet over Rostov-on-don

141
00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:45,269
the pilots again prepare to land

142
00:07:48,462 --> 00:07:50,062
sky Dubai 981
Rostov tower

143
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,020
you're clear to
land on runway 22

144
00:07:55,823 --> 00:07:57,823
good evening
your first officer here

145
00:07:57,828 --> 00:07:58,828
we'll be landing shortly

146
00:07:59,266 --> 00:08:01,733
once again we
apologize for the delay

147
00:08:03,231 --> 00:08:05,231
13 miles from runway 22

148
00:08:05,744 --> 00:08:08,343
the pilots lined up
for a second approach

149
00:08:10,619 --> 00:08:11,619
be advised

150
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:13,381
low altitude had wind 53 knots

151
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:17,699
even though winds are strong

152
00:08:17,762 --> 00:08:20,384
controllers aren't reporting
wind-shear at the runway

153
00:08:23,941 --> 00:08:24,941
flaps 30

154
00:08:25,345 --> 00:08:26,345
flaps 30

155
00:08:27,061 --> 00:08:28,661
but as they approach

156
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,650
they soon realize
something's not right

157
00:08:32,186 --> 00:08:33,186
check your speed

158
00:08:38,626 --> 00:08:39,666
okay
go around

159
00:08:40,906 --> 00:08:42,750
the pilots execute
another go-around

160
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:55,567
keep it at 50 degrees
goes up

161
00:08:55,606 --> 00:08:57,106
just 2000 feet in the air

162
00:08:57,388 --> 00:09:00,364
captain Sokratous is
wrestling with the Boeing 737

163
00:09:05,508 --> 00:09:06,548
seconds later

164
00:09:14,425 --> 00:09:16,825
flight 981 is diving
straight at the runway

165
00:09:23,644 --> 00:09:24,644
oh my god

166
00:09:35,662 --> 00:09:39,248
fire and emergency crews
rushed to the end of runway 22

167
00:09:40,749 --> 00:09:44,443
aircraft punched a crater in the
runway about a meter and half deep

168
00:09:45,261 --> 00:09:46,261
with

169
00:09:46,283 --> 00:09:49,104
wreckage
wreckage through everywhere

170
00:09:51,307 --> 00:09:53,982
fire-fighters battle the
flames through the night

171
00:09:56,382 --> 00:09:57,982
but there's no one to be rescued

172
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:04,004
all 62 on-board flight
981 are killed in the crash

173
00:10:06,941 --> 00:10:09,521
grieving families and the
world demand answers

174
00:10:15,105 --> 00:10:20,421
hours after flight Dubai flight 981
crashes on the runway at Rostov-on-don

175
00:10:20,918 --> 00:10:24,918
investigators from the IAC
The Interstate Aviation Committee

176
00:10:25,021 --> 00:10:26,021
arrived on the scene

177
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:33,402
the IAC is the lead air
accident investigation agency

178
00:10:34,024 --> 00:10:37,044
not just for Russia but for
several of the former soviet states

179
00:10:38,499 --> 00:10:41,901
the IAC must find the
cause for the horrific tragedy

180
00:10:44,981 --> 00:10:45,981
okay
that's great

181
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,040
that belongs over here

182
00:10:50,022 --> 00:10:53,565
wreckage from flight 981 is
laid out in a nearby hanger

183
00:10:53,924 --> 00:10:54,924
for closer inspection

184
00:10:55,626 --> 00:10:59,126
a team from the united Arab
emirate assist in the investigation

185
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,862
so how fast did the
plane hit the ground?

186
00:11:11,859 --> 00:11:14,922
the size of the debris would tell
weather it's a high speed impact

187
00:11:15,902 --> 00:11:17,582
or it's low speed impact

188
00:11:18,023 --> 00:11:20,023
there are clues in
pieces of wreckage

189
00:11:22,185 --> 00:11:23,685
it's how much left of it

190
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:27,930
it was all small pieces

191
00:11:28,941 --> 00:11:33,534
it describes a very high speed
and violent impact with the ground

192
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,420
it makes us question
what really happened

193
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,100
let's see it

194
00:11:45,194 --> 00:11:48,740
investigators wonder how the plane
could have gathered so much speed

195
00:11:49,382 --> 00:11:50,742
during an attempted landing

196
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:53,023
oh it's diving hard

197
00:11:53,506 --> 00:11:57,460
security footage gives them a
look at the last moments of flight 981

198
00:12:04,147 --> 00:12:07,747
flight 981 angle of descent
leads investigators to wonder

199
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:11,532
if the pilots were having
problems controlling their plane

200
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,583
maybe it's their
flight controls

201
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,060
you know I have seen it before

202
00:12:18,342 --> 00:12:21,863
Boeing 737 flight control
have a problematic history

203
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,260
March the Th 1991

204
00:12:29,024 --> 00:12:31,024
united airlines flight 585

205
00:12:31,581 --> 00:12:34,781
banks hard right and crashes
while attempting to land

206
00:12:35,102 --> 00:12:36,102
killing all on-board

207
00:12:37,104 --> 00:12:39,144
3 years later it happens again

208
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:43,298
USA flight 427 roles left
and crashes near Pittsburgh

209
00:12:46,661 --> 00:12:49,760
investigators with tearing
their out trying to figured it out

210
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,620
2 years passed without incident

211
00:12:53,184 --> 00:12:55,184
then while on approach to land

212
00:12:55,204 --> 00:12:59,042
the pilots of east-wind
airlines flight 517 lose control

213
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,943
this time the pilots regain
control of their plane

214
00:13:04,022 --> 00:13:06,422
and land safely in
Richmond Virginia

215
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,220
the plane is intact

216
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,900
investigators get
their best lead yet

217
00:13:14,283 --> 00:13:15,783
after 5 year of investigation

218
00:13:15,939 --> 00:13:18,501
the national transportation
safety board concluded

219
00:13:19,462 --> 00:13:20,462
that

220
00:13:20,824 --> 00:13:21,864
a power unit in the rudder

221
00:13:22,264 --> 00:13:25,264
that'd been responsible for
auto corner rudder hard over

222
00:13:26,501 --> 00:13:29,101
the rudder head
moved to one side

223
00:13:29,298 --> 00:13:32,831
and that caused the
aircraft to roll over

224
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,541
and then dive into the ground

225
00:13:35,824 --> 00:13:38,346
movements of rudder
and other control surfaces

226
00:13:38,619 --> 00:13:41,681
occur when pilots pushed
their rudder pedal or pull the yoke

227
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,901
power control units turns those
commands into actual movements

228
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,660
of the control surfaces

229
00:13:48,181 --> 00:13:50,204
it's similar to the
power steering on a car

230
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,660
hey there

231
00:13:56,222 --> 00:13:57,722
did you recover the PCUs?

232
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:03,286
investigators want to know if any
of flight 981's control units failed

233
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:05,879
yep
they're here

234
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,940
great

235
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
we need to test them

236
00:14:08,061 --> 00:14:10,061
much of the Boeing
737 was destroyed

237
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,900
during high speed impact

238
00:14:12,902 --> 00:14:14,903
but two of the power
control unit have survived

239
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,260
they could provide
crucial information

240
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,680
PCUs of the heart and soul of
the flight controls of the airplane

241
00:14:22,824 --> 00:14:24,624
and one of the first
question is if you have

242
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:26,464
an airplane that came
a screaming out of sky

243
00:14:26,479 --> 00:14:27,479
50 degree angle is

244
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:31,042
that we have a PCU
problem in the flight controls

245
00:14:32,983 --> 00:14:36,700
investigators carefully
examine the PCUs of flight 981

246
00:14:39,182 --> 00:14:41,182
they look for signs
of a malfunction

247
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:51,022
nothing wrong with the PCUs

248
00:14:51,578 --> 00:14:53,878
they were extensively
examine and found

249
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:58,104
they have had absolutely no connection to
what brought this airplane out of the sky

250
00:14:59,585 --> 00:15:01,585
with flight control
issues ruled out

251
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:04,018
the team turn to the
controller for insight

252
00:15:05,982 --> 00:15:07,982
take me through what you saw

253
00:15:07,985 --> 00:15:09,485
they were on final approach

254
00:15:13,343 --> 00:15:14,343
flight 981
Rostov tower

255
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:18,145
you're clear to
land on runway 22

256
00:15:20,165 --> 00:15:22,262
then they aborted
their first attempt to land

257
00:15:24,706 --> 00:15:25,706
they reported wind-shear

258
00:15:27,543 --> 00:15:29,043
Rostov tower
this is 981

259
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:32,042
we're conducting a go
around due to wind-shear

260
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,141
sky Dubai 981

261
00:15:34,582 --> 00:15:36,623
make holding pattern
that you're convenience

262
00:15:37,974 --> 00:15:39,541
they climbed and began holding

263
00:15:40,542 --> 00:15:42,042
how long with the holding?

264
00:15:42,545 --> 00:15:43,545
for a long time

265
00:15:44,266 --> 00:15:48,066
investigators learned that the
pilots held for almost 2 hours

266
00:15:48,164 --> 00:15:49,864
waiting for the
weather to improve

267
00:15:51,821 --> 00:15:52,821
sky Dubai 981

268
00:15:53,823 --> 00:15:55,843
request descent
for another approach

269
00:15:56,385 --> 00:15:57,385
then they asked to land

270
00:15:58,387 --> 00:16:01,421
but something went wrong when
the pilots made their second approach

271
00:16:04,023 --> 00:16:05,023
Rostov tower

272
00:16:05,106 --> 00:16:06,106
sky Dubai 981

273
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:07,706
we're going around

274
00:16:08,789 --> 00:16:11,293
did they say why they were
going around the second time?

275
00:16:11,341 --> 00:16:12,341
no

276
00:16:12,743 --> 00:16:14,243
they just said going around
that's all

277
00:16:16,385 --> 00:16:18,928
the next thing I knew the plane
was diving towards the runway

278
00:16:24,862 --> 00:16:26,902
did they report any
problems with the plane?

279
00:16:27,104 --> 00:16:28,104
no
nothing

280
00:16:29,903 --> 00:16:32,703
IAC investigators
still can't explain

281
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:37,319
why flight 981 suddenly banked
and then dive into runway 22

282
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,580
something had gone wrong
on the second go around

283
00:16:40,661 --> 00:16:42,528
but investigators
didn't know what

284
00:16:42,562 --> 00:16:44,462
was there a problem
with the airplane?

285
00:16:44,464 --> 00:16:46,464
did the pilots make a mistake?

286
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:47,705
there's no knowing yet

287
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:51,940
okay

288
00:16:52,102 --> 00:16:53,142
two go arounds

289
00:16:53,943 --> 00:16:55,623
one turns to disaster

290
00:16:56,144 --> 00:16:57,144
why?

291
00:16:57,299 --> 00:16:58,979
let's take a look
at the first one

292
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,200
investigators turn to FDR data

293
00:17:02,073 --> 00:17:05,653
to better understand
why fly Dubai flight 981

294
00:17:05,746 --> 00:17:07,546
performed one
successful go around

295
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,980
but crashed during the second

296
00:17:10,221 --> 00:17:11,621
investigators
need to figure out

297
00:17:11,702 --> 00:17:14,930
how the two go arounds
were different from each other

298
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:15,940
zoom a little bit

299
00:17:20,024 --> 00:17:21,024
look

300
00:17:22,265 --> 00:17:25,107
they confirmed the pilots
reacted to a wind shear alarm

301
00:17:25,347 --> 00:17:26,347
during the first approach

302
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,020
how did they respond?

303
00:17:30,741 --> 00:17:31,741
thrust jumps up to 102

304
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,300
so he applied max power

305
00:17:41,979 --> 00:17:43,659
what about the flaps?

306
00:17:43,701 --> 00:17:44,701
flaps are 30

307
00:17:46,342 --> 00:17:47,342
and gear

308
00:17:48,464 --> 00:17:49,464
remain down

309
00:17:57,463 --> 00:17:59,463
textbook wind shear go around

310
00:18:00,864 --> 00:18:02,864
pilot encounters a wind shear

311
00:18:02,946 --> 00:18:05,946
he'll typically perform a what's
call a wind shear scape maneuver

312
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:09,681
and that involves increasing
the engine power to maximum

313
00:18:09,741 --> 00:18:10,741
you leave a flaps down

314
00:18:11,182 --> 00:18:12,862
you leave the gear down

315
00:18:12,904 --> 00:18:14,904
wind shear ahead
wind shear go around

316
00:18:16,865 --> 00:18:18,865
the first go around
was pretty routine

317
00:18:19,155 --> 00:18:21,155
they responded appropriately

318
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,160
they did exactly what
they should have done

319
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,780
this

320
00:18:28,381 --> 00:18:30,061
is the second go around

321
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:33,840
investigators analyze the
second attempt at landing

322
00:18:33,902 --> 00:18:36,483
focusing in on the last
moments before the crash

323
00:18:37,264 --> 00:18:40,300
now did they get another wind
shear warning at the second time?

324
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,140
no
nothing

325
00:18:49,342 --> 00:18:50,342
look

326
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:53,965
there's leap in air speed
from 153 to 176 in seconds

327
00:18:56,019 --> 00:18:57,919
10 seconds before the pilots abort

328
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:01,022
a sudden increase in the
plane's airspeed was recorded

329
00:19:01,378 --> 00:19:03,378
investigators saw the airspeed

330
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,140
fluctuated for
more than 20 knots

331
00:19:06,742 --> 00:19:07,742
within a few seconds

332
00:19:08,103 --> 00:19:10,103
it's pretty strong gust of wind

333
00:19:10,506 --> 00:19:12,506
they can see that on
the flight not a recorder

334
00:19:13,901 --> 00:19:17,423
investigators determine that a
strong gust of winds struck the plane

335
00:19:19,504 --> 00:19:22,319
you can feel the wind increase
on the nose of the airplane

336
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:25,594
it's probably also moving
the airplane a little bit left or right

337
00:19:25,938 --> 00:19:27,739
it's not a pleasant
position to be in

338
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,710
how did the pilots
responds this time?

339
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,820
let me see

340
00:19:35,222 --> 00:19:36,822
they added max power

341
00:19:38,224 --> 00:19:39,224
okay
go around

342
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,540
and what about the
flaps and landing gear?

343
00:19:48,943 --> 00:19:50,443
flaps are retracted

344
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,183
gear retracted

345
00:19:57,305 --> 00:19:59,905
the data reveals that
on the second go around

346
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,102
the pilots performed
a different procedure

347
00:20:03,984 --> 00:20:07,506
they didn't fly the wind shear scape
maneuver during the second go around

348
00:20:08,226 --> 00:20:10,926
well looks like they were
doing a standard go around

349
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,460
on a standard go around

350
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,421
the flaps and landing
gear are retracted

351
00:20:18,143 --> 00:20:20,143
except they did it at max power

352
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:23,061
given how streamline
the aircraft is

353
00:20:23,102 --> 00:20:25,684
with the landing gear up
and the flaps largely retracted

354
00:20:26,785 --> 00:20:29,824
using max power is
very much overkill

355
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,960
investigators conclude
that on the second attempt

356
00:20:33,979 --> 00:20:36,521
the crew flew a
hybrid of two procedures

357
00:20:40,463 --> 00:20:43,063
they used the power of a
wind shear escape maneuver

358
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:46,547
with the gear and flaps
settings of a traditional go around

359
00:20:52,422 --> 00:20:53,422
so

360
00:20:54,103 --> 00:20:55,645
what would that
do to the plane?

361
00:20:56,618 --> 00:20:59,179
we need to take a look
at all the factors of plane

362
00:21:04,704 --> 00:21:06,884
they're holding on
for nearly two hours

363
00:21:06,946 --> 00:21:07,946
that's

364
00:21:10,139 --> 00:21:11,139
4 tons of fuel they burnt

365
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:16,644
the weight of the Boeing 737 is a
critical factor in the plane's performance

366
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:19,799
adding the weight of the plane

367
00:21:23,662 --> 00:21:24,662
total weight

368
00:21:25,103 --> 00:21:26,103
that's 54 tons

369
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:30,900
it's light plane

370
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,060
yeah

371
00:21:34,303 --> 00:21:36,103
at least weight
you know the crew would feel

372
00:21:36,164 --> 00:21:37,164
a faster acceleration

373
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,900
max power
no drag

374
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,713
from flaps or landing gear
low weight

375
00:21:51,505 --> 00:21:54,205
this plane could have been
accelerating dangerously fast

376
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,481
this is really an
accelerated situation

377
00:21:58,182 --> 00:22:00,682
this is a very powerful
airplane doing something

378
00:22:00,764 --> 00:22:02,799
that feels like you just
went into an after-burner

379
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,661
how much quicker did
this plane pickup speed

380
00:22:06,662 --> 00:22:07,662
on the second go around

381
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:13,799
we need to do modeling on this

382
00:22:15,981 --> 00:22:19,381
it was really incompetent
upon investigators to look further

383
00:22:19,384 --> 00:22:21,517
and the question of acceleration

384
00:22:23,571 --> 00:22:27,461
investigators turn to computer
modeling to answer a crucial question

385
00:22:27,781 --> 00:22:30,262
here is all the data for the
first and second go around

386
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:36,040
how did the rate of acceleration
differ at the start of the two attempts?

387
00:22:42,619 --> 00:22:43,619
first go around

388
00:22:45,461 --> 00:22:47,161
speed increased by 17 knots

389
00:22:48,223 --> 00:22:49,343
and the second

390
00:22:56,102 --> 00:22:57,382
second go around

391
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,340
25 knot increase

392
00:23:01,781 --> 00:23:04,122
lots of difference of 8 knots
between the two go arounds

393
00:23:04,302 --> 00:23:05,302
yeah

394
00:23:05,704 --> 00:23:08,244
it was a key part of the
findings when they realized that

395
00:23:08,265 --> 00:23:11,657
over 40% difference existent
between the acceleration

396
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,239
from the first go around
to the second go around

397
00:23:15,259 --> 00:23:19,283
could the increase in acceleration
have affected the pilots themselves?

398
00:23:20,543 --> 00:23:23,359
they calculate the impact
of the second go around

399
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:29,919
wow

400
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:33,340
look at the backward force
experienced by the pilot

401
00:23:33,983 --> 00:23:36,483
that faster acceleration
on the second go around

402
00:23:36,544 --> 00:23:38,611
would have pushed
him back into the seat

403
00:23:39,307 --> 00:23:42,089
the team also examines the
impact of vertical acceleration

404
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,099
g-force would have
lifted the pilots upwards

405
00:23:53,902 --> 00:23:55,702
the pilot would have
felt a slight unweighted

406
00:23:55,703 --> 00:23:57,303
he would come up out of seat

407
00:23:57,325 --> 00:23:58,325
so

408
00:23:58,465 --> 00:23:59,965
sudden acceleration like this

409
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,380
both horizontal and vertical

410
00:24:06,343 --> 00:24:07,343
that tricks on your mind

411
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:12,263
were captain Sokratous's
senses his worse enemy?

412
00:24:13,658 --> 00:24:15,399
maybe he experiences
Somatogravic Illusion

413
00:24:19,704 --> 00:24:20,984
check your speed

414
00:24:22,819 --> 00:24:23,939
okay
go around

415
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,260
a Somatogravic illusion

416
00:24:25,982 --> 00:24:28,563
is a dangerous form
of special disorientation

417
00:24:29,659 --> 00:24:33,380
when a plane accelerates quickly
with no visual reference of the horizon

418
00:24:33,819 --> 00:24:36,581
the gravitational forces
cause a pitch up illusion

419
00:24:37,218 --> 00:24:38,218
in the inner ear

420
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,260
the little hairs in the
inner ear bend backwards

421
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:44,960
tricking the brain into
thinking the head is tilting up

422
00:24:46,781 --> 00:24:47,781
we might be going level

423
00:24:48,221 --> 00:24:49,563
but if you cannot see outside

424
00:24:49,944 --> 00:24:50,944
that sensation

425
00:24:51,899 --> 00:24:52,899
on your vestibular system

426
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,120
is overwhelming and you know

427
00:24:55,141 --> 00:24:57,164
you would really feel
that you're climbing up

428
00:24:58,265 --> 00:25:01,820
the Somatogravic illusion is one
of the most lethal traps in aviation

429
00:25:02,704 --> 00:25:04,204
keep the nose up
15 degrees

430
00:25:05,783 --> 00:25:07,783
it's extremely
convincing illusion

431
00:25:11,901 --> 00:25:13,443
what was the actual
pitch of the plane

432
00:25:13,462 --> 00:25:16,262
after it accelerated during
the second go around

433
00:25:17,778 --> 00:25:20,540
almost 20 seconds
after the actual pitch

434
00:25:21,181 --> 00:25:22,181
was

435
00:25:22,582 --> 00:25:24,182
8.8 degrees nose up

436
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:29,324
investigators look for evidence
that the pilots of flight 981

437
00:25:29,588 --> 00:25:32,121
became severely
disoriented in the dark

438
00:25:34,902 --> 00:25:35,902
if you imagine that

439
00:25:36,623 --> 00:25:39,586
this glass of water
represents the fluid in your ear

440
00:25:40,266 --> 00:25:42,666
if you accelerated this
along a smooth surface

441
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:45,361
the water would be pushed
up against the back of the glass

442
00:25:45,821 --> 00:25:46,821
very much

443
00:25:46,982 --> 00:25:47,982
like this

444
00:25:48,384 --> 00:25:49,384
in other words

445
00:25:49,545 --> 00:25:51,225
it's the same effect

446
00:25:51,245 --> 00:25:52,605
as if you simply
tilted the glass

447
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:56,039
if you take visual
information of why

448
00:25:56,981 --> 00:25:59,381
what tends to
happen is that the pilot

449
00:25:59,542 --> 00:26:01,942
forgets about the acceleration

450
00:26:02,224 --> 00:26:04,224
and assumes that
everything he's feeling

451
00:26:04,305 --> 00:26:05,825
is due to the pitch

452
00:26:07,419 --> 00:26:09,319
and what was the
pilots perceived pitch?

453
00:26:10,543 --> 00:26:15,646
combining the horizontal and vertical
acceleration experienced by the pilot

454
00:26:15,905 --> 00:26:18,479
we can calculate the pitch
that is perceived by the pilot

455
00:26:20,061 --> 00:26:21,761
this is called the
illusionary pitch

456
00:26:22,582 --> 00:26:24,282
pilot's perceived pitch was

457
00:26:25,064 --> 00:26:26,064
21.6 degrees

458
00:26:27,906 --> 00:26:31,419
they compare the plane's actual
pitch to the pilot's illusionary pitch

459
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,420
during the second go around

460
00:26:35,222 --> 00:26:36,222
10 seconds later

461
00:26:36,663 --> 00:26:38,663
the plane's pitch up 3.9 degrees

462
00:26:45,302 --> 00:26:46,302
and

463
00:26:46,783 --> 00:26:48,716
the pilot perceived it to be

464
00:26:49,025 --> 00:26:50,525
26.7 degrees nose up

465
00:26:58,865 --> 00:27:00,265
wow
that's huge difference

466
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:09,360
this puts the captain
into a situation

467
00:27:09,542 --> 00:27:12,405
that he potentially will be
experiencing Somatogravic illusion

468
00:27:12,947 --> 00:27:14,547
the captain is feeling one thing

469
00:27:14,658 --> 00:27:16,439
but the aircraft is
doing something else

470
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,220
look at this

471
00:27:18,622 --> 00:27:19,742
nearly end of the flight

472
00:27:20,183 --> 00:27:22,063
the actual pitch is 7.6 degrees

473
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,461
and the perceived pitch

474
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,423
becomes well over 40

475
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,300
investigators
discover 3 instances

476
00:27:35,902 --> 00:27:37,702
where there was a
dramatic difference

477
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:39,323
between the plane's actual

478
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:41,139
and the pilot's perceived pitch

479
00:27:43,503 --> 00:27:44,503
keep at 15 degrees
nose up

480
00:27:45,784 --> 00:27:49,446
it's evidence that the pilots may have
experienced the Somatogravic illusion

481
00:27:49,446 --> 00:27:51,046
during the second go around

482
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,300
could the feeling of
the rapid acceleration

483
00:27:55,381 --> 00:27:58,281
have effected how the
pilots flew the plane?

484
00:27:58,748 --> 00:28:00,748
they dig deeper
into the flight data

485
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,441
well the captain push
forward on the yoke

486
00:28:05,782 --> 00:28:07,782
he was trying to pitch
the plane downward

487
00:28:07,879 --> 00:28:09,920
that's what his senses
were telling him to do

488
00:28:11,542 --> 00:28:14,042
the captain responding
more to his feelings

489
00:28:14,104 --> 00:28:16,866
than the what he was seeing on
any instrumentation in front of it

490
00:28:16,906 --> 00:28:19,500
he decides that he needs
to push the airplane forward

491
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,460
and counteract this
massive pitch-up

492
00:28:21,821 --> 00:28:23,821
he's trying to save
them by pitching down

493
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,780
wow
check this out

494
00:28:27,502 --> 00:28:29,502
he pushed the
stabilizer trim down

495
00:28:31,744 --> 00:28:32,744
from the data

496
00:28:33,185 --> 00:28:36,038
investigators see the captain
didn't just push the yoke

497
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:37,299
be careful

498
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,580
captain applies the stabilizer trim

499
00:28:41,142 --> 00:28:42,142
because

500
00:28:42,867 --> 00:28:45,020
he's trying to push the
nose of the aircraft down

501
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,260
wait
for how long?

502
00:28:52,419 --> 00:28:54,440
he held the trim
switch for 12 seconds

503
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:59,200
holding the switch for
12 seconds is unheard of

504
00:29:00,019 --> 00:29:01,019
that shouldn't

505
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,961
never be held for
that about of time

506
00:29:03,463 --> 00:29:06,985
the team discovers that
instead of pitching up to climb

507
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:09,886
the captain is pitching
the plane towards the ground

508
00:29:11,659 --> 00:29:12,659
no no no

509
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,400
eventually putting the
plane into a fatal dive

510
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:20,823
the sudden change
in direction is jarring

511
00:29:22,458 --> 00:29:25,041
at that time you would feel
like you're in a roller coaster

512
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,440
you know when you're

513
00:29:26,501 --> 00:29:28,661
coming up to the pick as
you were diving at speed

514
00:29:28,744 --> 00:29:30,444
is similar to that sensation

515
00:29:31,306 --> 00:29:35,460
the pitch down has another
disorienting effect on the pilot's senses

516
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:39,462
pitching down of the aircraft
would have caused by the captain

517
00:29:40,383 --> 00:29:41,383
and the first officer

518
00:29:41,824 --> 00:29:43,946
to experience a dramatic
change in the g-forces

519
00:29:44,387 --> 00:29:45,387
oh my god

520
00:29:47,499 --> 00:29:49,620
that would increase the
confusion in the cockpit

521
00:29:50,142 --> 00:29:51,822
as to what's going on

522
00:29:52,704 --> 00:29:56,765
investigators conclude that the
various g-forces on captain Sokratous

523
00:29:57,226 --> 00:29:59,767
caused his complete
spacial disorientation

524
00:30:01,701 --> 00:30:03,701
the captain push in
and pull in on the yoke

525
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,260
stumping on the rudder

526
00:30:05,422 --> 00:30:07,422
into dive you know
that shows confusion

527
00:30:07,703 --> 00:30:09,203
he's probably disoriented

528
00:30:11,498 --> 00:30:15,000
you know he's trying desperately to
get out of the sensation that he's feeling

529
00:30:17,224 --> 00:30:20,226
but there's one question
that steel troubles investigators

530
00:30:20,825 --> 00:30:22,959
was the first officer
feeling the illusion as well?

531
00:30:25,063 --> 00:30:29,144
even though the accelerations
experienced by both pilots was the same

532
00:30:30,985 --> 00:30:34,081
the perception of what
is happening can differ

533
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,480
and that can be due
to many different factors

534
00:30:36,861 --> 00:30:37,861
expectations

535
00:30:38,382 --> 00:30:39,382
what did they looking at?

536
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:41,299
their age
their experience

537
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,860
start at the second
go around please

538
00:30:45,702 --> 00:30:48,402
the cockpit voice recorder
could tell investigators

539
00:30:48,459 --> 00:30:51,959
if the first officer was also under the
influence of the Somatogravic illusion

540
00:30:54,861 --> 00:30:55,981
okay
go around

541
00:30:58,863 --> 00:30:59,863
careful

542
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,100
no no no

543
00:31:07,461 --> 00:31:08,461
don't do that

544
00:31:08,863 --> 00:31:09,863
he sees something wrong

545
00:31:10,822 --> 00:31:11,822
no
pull it

546
00:31:12,498 --> 00:31:13,618
pull it
pull it

547
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,920
he's telling to
pull back the yoke

548
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:17,001
pull it

549
00:31:18,103 --> 00:31:20,144
if he's feeling the same
illusion as the captain

550
00:31:20,899 --> 00:31:22,920
it sure doesn't seem
like he was affected by

551
00:31:24,582 --> 00:31:26,942
the first officer knew almost
trouble the aircraft was in

552
00:31:27,384 --> 00:31:29,664
knew the captain wasn't
responding the way he should

553
00:31:30,499 --> 00:31:31,499
oh my god

554
00:31:37,258 --> 00:31:40,758
investigators are left wondering
why the first officer didn't intervene

555
00:31:45,144 --> 00:31:47,644
you look at this first officer
trying his best and wonder

556
00:31:47,706 --> 00:31:50,706
why didn't you just take control
and say I've got the airplane

557
00:32:04,779 --> 00:32:06,779
he's been the flying
737800 for nearly two years

558
00:32:07,541 --> 00:32:08,541
he's fully certified

559
00:32:09,543 --> 00:32:12,124
investigators looking to
the first officer's background

560
00:32:12,584 --> 00:32:15,719
to understand why he
didn't take control of flight 981

561
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,941
when he saw that the captain
was making grave mistakes

562
00:32:20,498 --> 00:32:21,498
look

563
00:32:22,181 --> 00:32:24,181
his trainer wrote notes
on his assessment

564
00:32:25,022 --> 00:32:26,702
and this one is telling

565
00:32:26,743 --> 00:32:29,325
they find notes left by
one of his flight instructors

566
00:32:29,811 --> 00:32:30,811
that alarmed them

567
00:32:31,219 --> 00:32:34,319
one thing that could have
possibly saved that aircraft was

568
00:32:34,582 --> 00:32:37,582
discovered in a note that was
left behind by the flight instructor

569
00:32:38,464 --> 00:32:41,519
he needs to be a bit more assertive
in what is needed from the captain

570
00:32:42,141 --> 00:32:43,141
and he continues

571
00:32:44,143 --> 00:32:47,643
tell him what you want done and do
not wait for the captain inquire with you

572
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:50,099
or direct you in this regard

573
00:32:52,902 --> 00:32:54,342
he's not the type
to take control

574
00:32:57,981 --> 00:32:58,981
no
pull it

575
00:32:59,103 --> 00:33:00,783
pull it pull it pull it

576
00:33:01,343 --> 00:33:05,343
the first officer could see that
the captain was experiencing

577
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:08,142
enormous problems trying
to control the go around

578
00:33:08,422 --> 00:33:11,464
he really should have taken
some decisive action and intervene

579
00:33:12,105 --> 00:33:13,105
my god

580
00:33:18,542 --> 00:33:20,562
I still don't
understand something

581
00:33:21,103 --> 00:33:23,687
why did they try to land
the plane in the first place?

582
00:33:24,781 --> 00:33:28,481
the big mystery was why was this crew
so determine to land on Rostov-on-done

583
00:33:28,523 --> 00:33:31,123
when every other flight
had already diverted

584
00:33:31,625 --> 00:33:34,125
storm was pummeling
Rostov-on-done airport

585
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:36,179
as flight 981 circled above

586
00:33:38,703 --> 00:33:41,744
why didn't the pilots
divert to another airport?

587
00:33:43,506 --> 00:33:46,579
investigators look for answers
in the cockpit voice recording

588
00:33:49,103 --> 00:33:50,143
sky Dubai 981

589
00:33:50,823 --> 00:33:51,823
for your information

590
00:33:51,976 --> 00:33:54,527
previous flight went
to alternative airports

591
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,100
say other flights diverted

592
00:33:57,161 --> 00:33:58,361
there's no need

593
00:33:58,864 --> 00:33:59,864
I'm gonna keep flying

594
00:34:02,259 --> 00:34:04,559
investigators just
couldn't understand

595
00:34:04,621 --> 00:34:06,621
why they wanted
to fly and circles for

596
00:34:06,658 --> 00:34:07,658
almost two hours

597
00:34:09,221 --> 00:34:10,321
I'm gonna try this approach

598
00:34:10,478 --> 00:34:11,478
and if I can't make it

599
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,200
we'll have a go around

600
00:34:13,782 --> 00:34:15,582
and I will head to
Mineralnye Vody

601
00:34:15,683 --> 00:34:16,683
okay

602
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,704
okay captain
understood

603
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:19,770
who's talking to?

604
00:34:19,899 --> 00:34:21,579
the dispatcher on Dubai

605
00:34:21,702 --> 00:34:24,322
investigators finally get an
indication of the captain's rational

606
00:34:24,743 --> 00:34:26,263
for attempting another landing

607
00:34:27,024 --> 00:34:28,824
as the captain decides
whether to divert

608
00:34:29,499 --> 00:34:31,902
he contacts flight
Dubai flight dispatcher

609
00:34:32,121 --> 00:34:33,721
in the united Arab emirates

610
00:34:34,664 --> 00:34:37,164
we would like to recommend
you hold max as possible

611
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:41,779
dispatchers manage
the entire fleets operation

612
00:34:41,981 --> 00:34:43,021
for specific airline

613
00:34:43,822 --> 00:34:46,122
the dispatcher and the captain
are coequally responsible

614
00:34:46,664 --> 00:34:48,531
for the safety of the flight

615
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:49,939
there is a very delicate dance

616
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:53,923
that goes on between and among
the dispatchers and the captains

617
00:34:55,144 --> 00:34:57,725
the captain follows with the
dispatcher's recommendation

618
00:34:59,027 --> 00:35:02,560
minuter turns to hours as the
pilot wait for a chance to land

619
00:35:03,347 --> 00:35:06,382
I don't know man if we divert
we're gonna exceed our flying hours

620
00:35:10,946 --> 00:35:12,626
what are you looking at?

621
00:35:12,802 --> 00:35:13,922
Max Duty Hours

622
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,660
he's calculating his duty hours

623
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:21,282
regulations limit how
many hours pilots can fly

624
00:35:21,304 --> 00:35:22,304
during a duty period

625
00:35:24,426 --> 00:35:26,426
near the five and
a half hours now

626
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:30,923
the team learns that the pilots were
concern they might exceed their duty hours

627
00:35:32,518 --> 00:35:33,518
stop

628
00:35:34,139 --> 00:35:35,139
roll the map

629
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,520
they've been flying
for at least 5 hours

630
00:35:40,458 --> 00:35:42,960
it'll take another hour to
reach their alternative airport

631
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:43,980
wait out the storm

632
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:47,120
then they start to get back to
Rostov-on-Don before returning to Dubai

633
00:35:47,982 --> 00:35:50,782
diverting would put them
over their duty hours for the day

634
00:35:50,823 --> 00:35:51,823
right

635
00:35:52,545 --> 00:35:55,103
I think it can be clear by the
time we do this approach now

636
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,580
and even if we start now

637
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,100
I think we'll be good

638
00:35:59,821 --> 00:36:00,861
we'll be good

639
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,780
okay

640
00:36:03,741 --> 00:36:05,441
is he landing because it's clear

641
00:36:05,661 --> 00:36:06,661
or

642
00:36:06,782 --> 00:36:09,249
because he wants
to get on the ground

643
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:12,080
the conversation on the flight deck
before the second approach

644
00:36:12,381 --> 00:36:13,381
clearly showed that

645
00:36:13,822 --> 00:36:16,682
they weren't really thinking so
much about the safety of the landing

646
00:36:16,686 --> 00:36:18,186
just the fact that
they wanted to land

647
00:36:20,262 --> 00:36:21,762
I think I can give it a try

648
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,138
I agree
let's try

649
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,300
stop the recording

650
00:36:28,543 --> 00:36:30,643
so they decide to
circle for two hours

651
00:36:31,661 --> 00:36:34,061
after a four hour flight
in the middle of the night

652
00:36:39,547 --> 00:36:43,661
did the long flight affect the pilot's
ability to land the plane safely?

653
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:46,902
two hours of hold
six hours total time

654
00:36:47,182 --> 00:36:50,683
aren't we see decline in the decision
making capability because of fatigue?

655
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:52,626
tired?

656
00:36:53,618 --> 00:36:54,618
no

657
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,882
as investigators break
down flight 981's journey

658
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:02,844
from Dubai to Rostov-on-don

659
00:37:03,345 --> 00:37:04,945
they identify a glaring problem

660
00:37:05,619 --> 00:37:08,121
they were actually in
here for more than 6 hours

661
00:37:09,021 --> 00:37:11,621
it's almost 5:00AM their
time when they're landing

662
00:37:12,938 --> 00:37:14,438
the Circadian Rhythm is

663
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:19,300
body's natural alignment
with the day and night cycle

664
00:37:19,304 --> 00:37:21,804
the quad period is
roughly for four hour period

665
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:25,423
between 2 in the morning
and 6 in the morning

666
00:37:25,782 --> 00:37:30,425
that's the point of which your mental
ability is pretty much at is lowest

667
00:37:32,547 --> 00:37:34,047
I think I can give it a try

668
00:37:34,268 --> 00:37:35,268
I agree
let's try

669
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:41,283
investigators determine the crew
was suffering from operational fatigue

670
00:37:41,943 --> 00:37:43,643
as they launch their
second approach

671
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,880
good evening
your first officer here

672
00:37:48,983 --> 00:37:50,663
we'll be landing shortly

673
00:37:50,723 --> 00:37:53,190
once again we
apologize for the delay

674
00:37:53,265 --> 00:37:56,048
the decision to make a second
attempt to land at Rostov-on-don

675
00:37:56,667 --> 00:37:59,167
triggers a chain of events
that ends catastrophe

676
00:38:02,303 --> 00:38:03,303
check your speed

677
00:38:03,743 --> 00:38:05,623
as the aircraft is
hit by some wind

678
00:38:05,704 --> 00:38:08,566
the crew is forced into
executing another go around

679
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,540
okay
go around

680
00:38:11,661 --> 00:38:12,661
and this time

681
00:38:12,821 --> 00:38:14,401
it was all gonna go wrong

682
00:38:14,462 --> 00:38:16,962
captain Sokratous executes
a wind shear go around

683
00:38:17,305 --> 00:38:19,205
pushing the throttle
to max power

684
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:22,420
the first officer performs
a standard go around

685
00:38:23,263 --> 00:38:25,423
retracting the flaps and
raising the landing gear

686
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,541
both pilots were essentially flying
two different airplanes from there

687
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:34,322
this blunder factors heavily
into the catastrophe that followed

688
00:38:35,705 --> 00:38:38,705
flight 981 climbs from
Rostov-on-don at high speed

689
00:38:40,702 --> 00:38:41,702
when you light on fuel

690
00:38:41,781 --> 00:38:43,081
and you put the max thrust

691
00:38:43,104 --> 00:38:44,624
you will accelerate

692
00:38:47,025 --> 00:38:50,025
it's what happened in the last
few seconds that doomed flight 981

693
00:38:53,462 --> 00:38:54,842
keep it at 50 degrees
goes up

694
00:38:55,384 --> 00:38:57,884
at this moment captain
Sokratous fights an inner battle

695
00:38:59,627 --> 00:39:02,627
acceleration the aircraft
makes captain feels as though

696
00:39:03,262 --> 00:39:07,344
the aircraft is pitching up
a lot more than actually is

697
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:09,745
spacial orientation
deteriorates rapidly

698
00:39:12,907 --> 00:39:14,907
your vestibular senses
your middle ear

699
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,860
are all telling you
the wrong thing

700
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:21,324
the captain counters the pitch up
feeling of a Somatogravic Illusion

701
00:39:21,324 --> 00:39:22,824
by pushing the yoke forward

702
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:29,900
the captain has lost touch with the reality
of what is happening to the airplane

703
00:39:30,425 --> 00:39:31,425
then the final blow

704
00:39:32,939 --> 00:39:35,980
the captain holds that stabilizer trim
button down for about 12 seconds

705
00:39:38,023 --> 00:39:41,523
with the sudden forcing
of the aircraft nose down

706
00:39:41,625 --> 00:39:42,625
and stabilizer trim

707
00:39:43,908 --> 00:39:46,708
the aircraft transitions
from the climb

708
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,720
very suddenly

709
00:39:48,142 --> 00:39:49,642
into a dive

710
00:39:50,139 --> 00:39:52,639
the aircraft is now in a
very dangerous situation

711
00:39:52,701 --> 00:39:54,501
which the captain is
unable to overcome

712
00:39:55,503 --> 00:39:56,503
my god

713
00:39:58,419 --> 00:40:00,019
they're accelerating rapidly

714
00:40:00,141 --> 00:40:04,082
and first officer finally gets
on the yoke and tries to pull

715
00:40:04,664 --> 00:40:08,165
but the controls on the left
side govern where the airplane is

716
00:40:09,738 --> 00:40:11,438
and even to a certain point

717
00:40:12,301 --> 00:40:13,301
and there's no recovery

718
00:40:14,021 --> 00:40:16,703
nose diving at full
throttle towards the runway

719
00:40:17,104 --> 00:40:19,305
captain Sokratous is
completely disoriented

720
00:40:20,466 --> 00:40:22,466
when he adds rudder
at the last moment

721
00:40:22,938 --> 00:40:25,961
he's lost all awareness
of how the plane is flying

722
00:40:33,641 --> 00:40:34,641
pilots in this case were

723
00:40:35,901 --> 00:40:37,601
conducting the flight very well

724
00:40:37,864 --> 00:40:39,864
right up until those
last few moments

725
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,180
and then

726
00:40:42,461 --> 00:40:43,961
it already just fell apart

727
00:40:49,463 --> 00:40:52,463
the IAC investigation
into the crash of flight 981

728
00:40:53,507 --> 00:40:56,507
is a landmark case of
how spacial disorientation

729
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:57,860
can end in disaster

730
00:40:59,702 --> 00:41:02,602
this accident is wake-up call for the
industry as one of the accident

731
00:41:02,619 --> 00:41:04,419
that pay for the
way into increase

732
00:41:04,901 --> 00:41:06,901
training in spatial
disorientation

733
00:41:09,144 --> 00:41:10,664
in the final report

734
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:13,350
investigators blame the
captain's string of errors

735
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:16,102
on his diminished
psychological state

736
00:41:16,822 --> 00:41:20,022
the IAC recommends that fly
Dubai provide better training

737
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:22,180
on the manual
operation of stabilizer trim

738
00:41:23,822 --> 00:41:26,505
so the pilots don't make
the same mistake again

739
00:41:27,739 --> 00:41:29,439
researching to human factors

740
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:33,340
including situations like this
where disorientation likely occurred

741
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:35,824
is at the forefront of
aviation safety research

742
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,740
we are training our
pilots on simulators

743
00:41:39,861 --> 00:41:41,861
to experience these illusions

744
00:41:41,862 --> 00:41:43,062
before they experience in this

745
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:45,084
so they can recognize
those situations

746
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:51,060
I think the flight Dubai
accident shows how quickly

747
00:41:52,104 --> 00:41:54,881
your senses can overtake you

748
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,420
and one of the key lesson is

749
00:41:56,941 --> 00:41:57,941
the pilots to

750
00:41:58,381 --> 00:42:00,061
trust in their instruments

751
00:42:00,343 --> 00:42:03,543
to take a step back from what
may they think they're experiencing

752
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:07,341
to actually understand
what the airplane is doing

753
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:09,983
you've gotta keep
the airplane flying
