00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:07,360
one of the world's most sophisticated war
planes speeds down the runway at Guam

45
rotate

3
00:00:10,383 --> 00:00:12,504
their mission that day
was to return home

4
00:00:14,907 --> 00:00:17,207
but the take off
ends in disaster

5
00:00:19,341 --> 00:00:23,145
a two billion dollar stealth
bomber goes up in flames

6
00:00:24,105 --> 00:00:26,165
we wanna know what
the heck just happened

7
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,220
the entire fleet is grounded

8
00:00:29,901 --> 00:00:32,901
this could be the end of
the B-2 bomber program

9
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:35,083
plane goes full nose up

10
00:00:36,106 --> 00:00:39,752
investigators analyze
the flight second by second

11
00:00:40,031 --> 00:00:41,111
what about this?

12
00:00:41,185 --> 00:00:44,859
and discover a hidden vulnerability
in the B-2's electronic armor

13
00:00:45,419 --> 00:00:48,562
there is no way a pilot would
understand the system well enough

14
00:00:49,105 --> 00:00:51,105
to realize what could happen

15
00:00:51,339 --> 00:00:52,699
what is going on?

16
00:01:24,306 --> 00:01:25,906
you good to go sir
thank you

17
00:01:27,698 --> 00:01:30,798
Major Ryan Link and
Captain Justin Grieve

18
00:01:30,821 --> 00:01:34,345
are ending a four month
deployment in Guam

19
00:01:35,265 --> 00:01:36,265
better

20
00:01:37,068 --> 00:01:38,268
yeah
looks good

21
00:01:39,904 --> 00:01:41,404
okay
let's head home then

22
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:42,583
copy that

23
00:01:44,708 --> 00:01:48,788
Andersen air force base is both a
training facility and the launching point

24
00:01:48,862 --> 00:01:51,362
for US military operations
in the western pacific

25
00:01:56,989 --> 00:01:58,529
generator one is on

26
00:02:00,341 --> 00:02:02,341
engine's ground idle
27 percent confirmed

27
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:06,023
back to Missouri Missouri

28
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,600
their mission that day
was to return home

29
00:02:10,824 --> 00:02:12,824
our time was up in Guam
and

30
00:02:14,221 --> 00:02:17,362
they were beginning a
16 hour continuous flight

31
00:02:17,863 --> 00:02:20,463
back to Knob Noster Missouri
Whiteman Air Force Base

32
00:02:20,984 --> 00:02:21,984
which was our home base

33
00:02:23,545 --> 00:02:26,541
they're one of two crews
returning home today

34
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:27,581
in a unique war plane

35
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:29,583
the B-2 bomber

36
00:02:31,425 --> 00:02:33,425
it was flying wing design

37
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,760
and really a marvel
of engineering

38
00:02:38,183 --> 00:02:40,183
the air force ended up spending

39
00:02:40,463 --> 00:02:44,063
44 billion dollars to
develop and then field

40
00:02:44,106 --> 00:02:45,706
the fleet of B-2 bombers

41
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,630
developed in the 1980
during the cold war

42
00:02:52,779 --> 00:02:56,602
the stealth bomber was
designed to evade soviet radar

43
00:02:58,385 --> 00:03:00,567
there are only 21
of them in existence

44
00:03:02,347 --> 00:03:06,947
it can sneak in, with much
less chance of being detected

45
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:11,645
either by enemy surface
to air missile defenses or

46
00:03:11,667 --> 00:03:12,787
enemy fighters

47
00:03:16,689 --> 00:03:17,689
tower
that's 5

48
00:03:17,782 --> 00:03:20,282
start-up is complete
you can activate our flight plan

49
00:03:22,586 --> 00:03:26,942
refueling number one will
be at ARCP charlie at 07350

50
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,980
expecting to unload
51,000 pounds

51
00:03:29,783 --> 00:03:31,383
control point charlie
copy

52
00:03:34,303 --> 00:03:37,503
today the 7000 mile journey
home from Guam

53
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:40,902
will require the crew to
refuel near the Hawaii islands

54
00:03:41,302 --> 00:03:42,802
and then over California

55
00:03:43,584 --> 00:03:47,660
before reaching Whiteman
Air Force Base in Missouri

56
00:03:50,023 --> 00:03:53,524
Major Link is a qualified
instructor on the B-2

57
00:03:54,265 --> 00:03:56,665
Captain Grieve is
an experienced pilot

58
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,276
with more than 2500 hours
of military flying experience

59
00:04:02,425 --> 00:04:06,502
they are among only 300
pilots qualified to fly the B-2

60
00:04:08,543 --> 00:04:11,604
the aviators in the B-2 at that
time are absolute best of the best

61
00:04:12,187 --> 00:04:13,187
they were hand-picked

62
00:04:13,899 --> 00:04:15,899
they were vetted extensively

63
00:04:16,182 --> 00:04:19,584
they were truly in
elite group of aviators

64
00:04:22,659 --> 00:04:25,243
Grieve and Link are
second in line to take off

65
00:04:27,424 --> 00:04:30,106
the plane they're flying
is named spirit of Kansas

66
00:04:32,661 --> 00:04:36,366
every B-2 bomber is named
after an individual state

67
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:37,625
except for two

68
00:04:38,036 --> 00:04:40,587
there is spirit of America
and spirit of Kitty Hawk

69
00:04:46,462 --> 00:04:48,462
that's 6+1
clear for take off

70
00:04:49,025 --> 00:04:50,025
maintain 5000

71
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,900
pitot heat is on

72
00:04:57,142 --> 00:04:59,142
clear right
go to line up

73
00:05:00,818 --> 00:05:05,718
the pilots must carefully maneuver
the massive 168 ton bomber

74
00:05:05,742 --> 00:05:07,422
to the foot of the runway

75
00:05:07,714 --> 00:05:10,847
to ensure they don't put
any dents in the B-2's shell

76
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,560
try to taxi slowly

77
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,583
because you're low
observable platform

78
00:05:17,828 --> 00:05:18,828
so
obviously

79
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,200
if you scrape the airplane

80
00:05:21,223 --> 00:05:23,921
you degrade the capability
of the war fighting machine

81
00:05:29,343 --> 00:05:30,343
that's 5
go channel 5

82
00:05:31,903 --> 00:05:32,903
that's 5 copy
channel 5

83
00:05:35,824 --> 00:05:36,824
that's 5
channel 5

84
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,010
our lead is airborne
we're going 60

85
00:05:45,141 --> 00:05:47,964
on this flight captain Grieve
is the mission commander

86
00:05:49,665 --> 00:05:51,225
what's different is

87
00:05:51,344 --> 00:05:52,344
the captain

88
00:05:52,823 --> 00:05:55,903
like you would think the aircraft
commander is actually on the right seat

89
00:05:55,904 --> 00:05:57,844
we call them a mission commander

90
00:05:57,905 --> 00:05:59,905
and the pilot is
in the left seat

91
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,060
first MCT

92
00:06:14,824 --> 00:06:17,824
the very first time I flew
the B-2 I felt like I was a bird

93
00:06:18,302 --> 00:06:19,802
it was so smooth

94
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:23,094
you just slightly touch
the flight controls

95
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:24,674
and she does what you want

96
00:06:45,269 --> 00:06:46,389
what was that?

97
00:06:47,502 --> 00:06:48,502
FCS caution

98
00:06:49,503 --> 00:06:50,503
stop or go?

99
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,266
go
warning rescinding

100
00:06:54,029 --> 00:06:56,929
in the B-2, there's two
different kind of caution lines

101
00:06:57,382 --> 00:06:58,982
the red one and yellow one

102
00:06:59,101 --> 00:07:01,601
in this case it was yellow
which is just precautionary

103
00:07:01,664 --> 00:07:04,345
a red caution light you
probably abort the take off

104
00:07:05,627 --> 00:07:06,627
145
rotate

105
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,680
spirit of Kansas lifts
off the runway at Guam

106
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,202
almost immediately the massive
bomber pitches up dramatically

107
00:07:19,942 --> 00:07:21,805
next thing they know
they're going straight up

108
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:25,239
the momentum of that maneuver up

109
00:07:25,623 --> 00:07:28,623
cause the pilots to
experience about 1.6 G

110
00:07:30,343 --> 00:07:33,048
their aircraft don't want to do
what is was supposed to be doing

111
00:07:35,101 --> 00:07:36,101
full power

112
00:07:38,346 --> 00:07:39,946
the B-2 isn't gaining altitude

113
00:07:41,185 --> 00:07:42,985
it's still only 80
feet off the ground

114
00:07:43,999 --> 00:07:44,999
and losing speed

115
00:07:46,584 --> 00:07:48,584
make believe you're in
your automobile right now

116
00:07:49,147 --> 00:07:52,186
you turn left but
that car turns right

117
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:53,806
what is going on?

118
00:07:55,061 --> 00:07:56,601
that's not the way
he supposed to work

119
00:07:56,781 --> 00:07:58,505
that's the scenario
these pilots were in

120
00:07:59,627 --> 00:08:02,585
the pilots now feel their
airplane shaking violently

121
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,840
and realize it's on
the verge of stalling

122
00:08:06,981 --> 00:08:08,581
from my 50 years flying the B-2

123
00:08:09,543 --> 00:08:12,164
the only time I felt the B-2
shake is in the simulator

124
00:08:13,228 --> 00:08:15,962
that's the only scenario
when you would feel that shake

125
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:17,939
you never feel it otherwise

126
00:08:19,742 --> 00:08:21,142
the plane's left wing drops

127
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:26,149
Grieve knows the plane
is heading for the ground

128
00:08:27,383 --> 00:08:31,205
there is only one thing he can
do to save his and major link's life

129
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:38,101
they are trained to have that God
feel of when to pull the ejection handle

130
00:08:38,942 --> 00:08:42,820
and don't forget the air force wants
these pilots to eject and save themselves

131
00:08:43,464 --> 00:08:47,166
there's no shame in ejecting ever
even from a billion dollar bomber

132
00:08:49,665 --> 00:08:52,509
Grieve doesn't have time
to think about his decision

133
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,504
the B-2's left wing is
now scraping the ground

134
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,790
we're gonna get out

135
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:05,160
explosive tear a hole in the
fuselage above the cockpit

136
00:09:05,182 --> 00:09:07,682
and rockets eject the
pilots from the aircraft

137
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,421
the stealth bomber hits the
ground and burst into flames

138
00:09:18,668 --> 00:09:19,668
alert one
alert one

139
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:22,302
runway 6 romeo
runway 6 romeo

140
00:09:25,746 --> 00:09:26,746
I'm stunned

141
00:09:27,186 --> 00:09:29,904
the B-2 is gone through 19
years and 3 wars without a crash

142
00:09:30,589 --> 00:09:31,589
this is unheard of

143
00:09:32,859 --> 00:09:36,002
one of the world's most advanced
warplanes has been incinerated

144
00:09:36,504 --> 00:09:37,504
during a routine take off

145
00:09:39,128 --> 00:09:41,265
the whole world is left
wondering what went wrong

146
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,870
for two straight days

147
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:52,470
fire fighters at Anderson air-force base
in Guam battle the flaming wreckage

148
00:09:52,663 --> 00:09:54,103
of B-2 bomber spirit of Kansas

149
00:09:55,505 --> 00:09:58,205
with the price tag
of 2 billion dollars

150
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,373
this is the most expensive
aviation accident of all time

151
00:10:03,021 --> 00:10:06,123
crash at Guam did
shake us to the core in the

152
00:10:06,162 --> 00:10:08,662
we wanna know what
the heck just happen?

153
00:10:10,066 --> 00:10:12,766
operations of the entire
B-2 fleet are suspended

154
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,100
even before an
investigation is launched

155
00:10:16,719 --> 00:10:17,719
it's bad

156
00:10:17,803 --> 00:10:20,365
to have to stand down
the B-2 flying operations

157
00:10:20,862 --> 00:10:22,939
on the other hand
they have no choice

158
00:10:23,619 --> 00:10:27,302
they have no idea what's
going wrong inside that B-2

159
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,083
and they have to find out

160
00:10:29,223 --> 00:10:32,081
before they risk any
more B-2s in flight

161
00:10:34,581 --> 00:10:38,481
US air force appoints the well
respected general floyd carpenter

162
00:10:38,503 --> 00:10:39,503
to lead the investigation

163
00:10:41,905 --> 00:10:44,405
because of the high
profile nature of this accident

164
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:46,519
I think they expect a
lot of media interest

165
00:10:46,661 --> 00:10:48,898
and so as a senior
greater general

166
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:54,043
I was picked I think to get the airplanes
back operational and clear to fly again

167
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,862
you never gonna believe this

168
00:10:57,659 --> 00:11:00,721
investigators watch the
accident unfold on security video

169
00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:04,459
great to have the video

170
00:11:04,901 --> 00:11:07,460
and we were able to glean
a lot of information from it

171
00:11:09,423 --> 00:11:12,007
video of the take off shows
that as the plane lifted off

172
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,000
it pitched nose high

173
00:11:15,861 --> 00:11:18,442
your first reaction when you
see that airplane pitched up

174
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,980
is like

175
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:21,059
what are they doing?

176
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,380
the plane then drifts left

177
00:11:23,742 --> 00:11:25,544
before the left wing
scrapes the ground

178
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,721
left wing falls off
and hits the ground

179
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:32,181
and through that whole
thing you were thinking

180
00:11:32,263 --> 00:11:33,263
where is the crew?

181
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,380
first time you see it

182
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:39,168
you quite don't realize
the crew actually ejects

183
00:11:39,303 --> 00:11:40,904
can you take it
back for me please?

184
00:11:48,023 --> 00:11:49,023
stop

185
00:11:51,099 --> 00:11:52,099
that's the pilots

186
00:11:53,381 --> 00:11:54,381
one and two

187
00:11:57,344 --> 00:12:00,947
the video shows the pilots ejecting
just as the plane hits the ground

188
00:12:02,938 --> 00:12:05,221
both pilots had been taken
to hospital for evaluation

189
00:12:07,742 --> 00:12:09,743
Justin Grieve has suffered
a serious back injure

190
00:12:10,585 --> 00:12:12,585
from the forces of ejection

191
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:18,079
it was a waiting process for us and
gathering all the other information

192
00:12:18,183 --> 00:12:21,203
while we waited to talk to them and
hear their side of what really happened

193
00:12:24,227 --> 00:12:28,762
investigator study the mechanical
and computer systems that control the jet

194
00:12:29,302 --> 00:12:30,302
perfect

195
00:12:30,862 --> 00:12:31,862
what about the actuator?

196
00:12:33,698 --> 00:12:35,759
we had so much of the
aircraft already available

197
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,960
actuators, engines
all those things

198
00:12:37,981 --> 00:12:40,242
what you're really looking
for in this type of accident

199
00:12:41,103 --> 00:12:44,203
they quickly determine that all of
the plane's flight control surfaces

200
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:46,221
were functioning on take off

201
00:12:47,904 --> 00:12:50,304
pretty quickly we were
able to rule out the fact

202
00:12:50,382 --> 00:12:51,941
that the engines
were not a problem

203
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,821
the hydraulics were not problem
the flight controls were not problem

204
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,480
I pulled these from the video

205
00:13:01,624 --> 00:13:02,624
up

206
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:04,179
up

207
00:13:04,861 --> 00:13:05,861
up

208
00:13:06,542 --> 00:13:07,902
it's a beautiful sunny morning

209
00:13:07,962 --> 00:13:09,466
why does a bomber
pitches nose up and

210
00:13:09,524 --> 00:13:12,124
crashed in a fireball
on the runway at Guam?

211
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:14,626
is this a weighting
balance issue?

212
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:19,122
many deployment like that is
not uncommon to load aircraft

213
00:13:19,662 --> 00:13:20,662
with spare parts

214
00:13:21,103 --> 00:13:23,143
or other equipment that
you might wanna get home

215
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:25,079
and not wait to ship home

216
00:13:25,581 --> 00:13:27,602
some classified material
going back to white man

217
00:13:28,503 --> 00:13:29,503
personal belongings

218
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:31,459
gear

219
00:13:31,861 --> 00:13:34,361
so center gravity
became a big issue for us

220
00:13:34,662 --> 00:13:35,662
could it have been that?

221
00:13:38,061 --> 00:13:40,081
not enough to disrupt
their balance there

222
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:46,654
the B-2 is capable of carrying
40,000 pounds of weaponry

223
00:13:47,941 --> 00:13:50,741
but spirit of Kansas
wasn't carrying any bombs

224
00:13:50,782 --> 00:13:53,543
or other heavy cargo that
could have shift if on take off

225
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:58,581
we found up that there
really wasn't a lot of equipment

226
00:13:58,621 --> 00:14:00,262
there were no
ammunitions being carried

227
00:14:00,347 --> 00:14:02,347
so everything was in
balance as it should have been

228
00:14:03,461 --> 00:14:05,962
and so center gravity
was ruled out pretty quick

229
00:14:07,984 --> 00:14:12,082
investigators look more closely
at the take off rolls of both B-2s

230
00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:14,059
on the day of the accident

231
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:17,982
for clues as to why spirit of
Kansas couldn't get airborne

232
00:14:18,144 --> 00:14:19,744
like the plane just ahead of it

233
00:14:19,865 --> 00:14:20,865
spirit of south Carolina

234
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,540
okay

235
00:14:24,707 --> 00:14:25,707
pause it

236
00:14:25,983 --> 00:14:26,983
right there

237
00:14:28,102 --> 00:14:29,102
okay

238
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:33,220
so south Carolina lifts off
just passed that taxi way

239
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:38,142
right above here

240
00:14:38,705 --> 00:14:40,205
because we didn't have video

241
00:14:40,699 --> 00:14:41,699
we had to look at

242
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,002
take off roll of
this lead aircraft

243
00:14:44,382 --> 00:14:45,982
compare to the second aircraft

244
00:14:47,225 --> 00:14:48,225
and

245
00:14:48,338 --> 00:14:49,338
stop

246
00:14:51,662 --> 00:14:52,782
okay, our guys

247
00:14:52,822 --> 00:14:54,422
lift off just passed

248
00:14:54,803 --> 00:14:55,803
that

249
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,861
runway light which is this guy

250
00:14:59,302 --> 00:15:00,302
right here

251
00:15:01,702 --> 00:15:02,702
look at that

252
00:15:03,051 --> 00:15:07,662
we found out that spirit of Kansas took off
1500 feet shorter than its lead aircraft

253
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:10,541
what is going on?

254
00:15:11,822 --> 00:15:14,900
again video helped us understand
that take off roll was shorter

255
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,960
but didn't understand why?

256
00:15:30,584 --> 00:15:35,222
the investigators turn to data from
the bomber's flight recorder for answers

257
00:15:36,765 --> 00:15:41,183
the plane is still on the
ground 546 feet above see level

258
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,380
not 682

259
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:48,240
so the altitude is off by 136 feet

260
00:15:49,179 --> 00:15:53,179
now sir there is no way
he got up to 145 knots

261
00:15:53,623 --> 00:15:55,623
using only this much runway

262
00:15:56,466 --> 00:15:57,466
agreed

263
00:15:57,518 --> 00:15:59,882
something happened and
causes airplane to pitch up

264
00:15:59,981 --> 00:16:01,961
but so far we've ruled
out all the easy stuff

265
00:16:02,383 --> 00:16:05,704
and so now we start looking into
other situations that could have cause

266
00:16:06,018 --> 00:16:07,818
aircraft to do what it did

267
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:09,290
no here sir

268
00:16:10,263 --> 00:16:11,963
the noses lifting off the ground

269
00:16:13,024 --> 00:16:16,139
but the plane registers a
pitch down of -8 degrees

270
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,260
now obviously

271
00:16:19,262 --> 00:16:20,862
this plane is not pitching down

272
00:16:22,103 --> 00:16:23,603
but the computer thinks it is

273
00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:26,899
that's why it tried to lift the
nose higher and higher and higher

274
00:16:27,661 --> 00:16:28,661
until it stalled

275
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:32,039
once we got performance
parameters of the aircraft

276
00:16:32,119 --> 00:16:34,900
we were able to determine that
the airplane thought that it was

277
00:16:34,941 --> 00:16:36,541
-8 degrees angle of attack

278
00:16:37,503 --> 00:16:40,519
then you start going back
to say why did it think that

279
00:16:43,342 --> 00:16:46,747
the heart of the B-2 bomber is
its sophisticated on board computer

280
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:48,798
known as its flight
control system

281
00:16:49,562 --> 00:16:50,562
or FCS

282
00:16:51,902 --> 00:16:52,902
without it

283
00:16:52,963 --> 00:16:56,043
it would be impossible the pilots to
make all the calculation necessary

284
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,080
to keep the unusual
aircraft flying

285
00:17:00,861 --> 00:17:01,861
you don't have a tail

286
00:17:02,302 --> 00:17:03,422
think about that

287
00:17:03,582 --> 00:17:05,602
you don't have any kind
of vertical empennage

288
00:17:06,102 --> 00:17:07,602
it's just a big flying wing

289
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:10,740
accurate data is crucial

290
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,421
on a B-2 pilots tell the computer
what they want the plane to do

291
00:17:16,263 --> 00:17:18,443
and the computer determines
how to accomplish that

292
00:17:20,778 --> 00:17:23,901
the flight computers move
the surfaces of this airplane

293
00:17:24,741 --> 00:17:29,839
in a way that's not intuitive to
any pilot of any other aircraft

294
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:36,900
simply but it'd be nearly
impossible to fly this airplane safely

295
00:17:37,144 --> 00:17:38,824
without flight computers

296
00:17:40,547 --> 00:17:41,547
so

297
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,922
air speed, climb angle,
and altitude are all off

298
00:17:49,545 --> 00:17:52,780
how does that
happen on this plane?

299
00:17:53,741 --> 00:17:57,983
investigators need to determine why
the stealth bomber was getting faulty data

300
00:18:00,507 --> 00:18:02,507
let's see what the
pilots can tell us

301
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,782
we weren't looking to blame them
or you know point a finger at them

302
00:18:08,424 --> 00:18:10,045
but there were tough
questions to ask

303
00:18:15,139 --> 00:18:16,739
three weeks after the accident

304
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,700
the pilots of spirit of Kansas agreed
to be interviewed by investigators

305
00:18:26,379 --> 00:18:27,379
okay captain

306
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,360
how about we
take it from the top?

307
00:18:33,459 --> 00:18:34,459
started up at 9:15

308
00:18:35,461 --> 00:18:39,002
a few minutes later major Links called
the calibration message during start up

309
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:45,183
the pilots tell investigators that they
received an unusual computer message

310
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:46,858
shortly after start up

311
00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:48,299
never seen that

312
00:18:49,021 --> 00:18:50,021
me neither

313
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:54,658
hey chief we're seeing
air data cal message

314
00:18:54,658 --> 00:18:56,660
can you send someone
up here to clear that up?

315
00:18:58,661 --> 00:19:01,423
air data cal stands
for air data calibration

316
00:19:03,098 --> 00:19:04,098
in a simplest term

317
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:09,082
the air data calibration gives the
aircraft its orientation to the universe

318
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:15,843
there are 24 sensors flush
mounted near the nose of the B-2

319
00:19:16,384 --> 00:19:17,984
that constantly
measure air pressure

320
00:19:18,946 --> 00:19:22,046
the planes computer uses
those readings to calculate

321
00:19:22,067 --> 00:19:24,667
altitude, air speed
and angle of attack

322
00:19:26,581 --> 00:19:28,742
all 24 system have
memory in them

323
00:19:29,142 --> 00:19:31,324
and they're measuring
themselves against all the others

324
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:33,404
and so if they get
out of the balance

325
00:19:33,499 --> 00:19:35,161
if one is reading
too low or two high

326
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,200
it calls for an air
data calibration

327
00:19:37,502 --> 00:19:38,502
and the pilots see that

328
00:19:39,739 --> 00:19:40,739
when that occurs

329
00:19:40,901 --> 00:19:42,581
they call out maintenance

330
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:46,143
okay

331
00:19:46,864 --> 00:19:48,958
let's see what we can
do to clear this for you

332
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,981
can you put it in
maintenance mode for me?

333
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:00,782
that's good

334
00:20:06,781 --> 00:20:07,901
you good to go sir

335
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:09,624
thank you

336
00:20:09,784 --> 00:20:13,340
so they have these 24 sensors, they
make sure they communicating correctly

337
00:20:13,502 --> 00:20:14,622
and if they do

338
00:20:14,903 --> 00:20:15,903
they let it go forward

339
00:20:18,588 --> 00:20:19,868
pitot heat is on

340
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,420
less than an hour later

341
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,140
clear right

342
00:20:24,343 --> 00:20:25,383
go to line up

343
00:20:25,423 --> 00:20:28,443
the pilots maneuver the massive
bomber to the start of the runway

344
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,260
okay

345
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:34,179
go on

346
00:20:34,729 --> 00:20:37,542
everything was 100 percent
routine until we get a 100 knots

347
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:39,402
that's when we got
the FCS master caution

348
00:20:39,704 --> 00:20:42,219
you got a master caution
while you're still on the ground

349
00:20:43,621 --> 00:20:44,621
yes sir

350
00:20:44,904 --> 00:20:46,024
just a flicker

351
00:20:49,967 --> 00:20:50,967
100 knots

352
00:20:58,944 --> 00:21:00,983
before I even push the
button it rescind itself

353
00:21:02,066 --> 00:21:03,186
what was that?

354
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:05,347
FCS caution

355
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:08,220
after a 100 knots to our
decision road take speed

356
00:21:09,141 --> 00:21:11,141
we will abort for
safety of flight items

357
00:21:11,864 --> 00:21:14,979
we define safety of flight as
we're unable to control this airplane

358
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:18,241
or there is something on the
road where you're gonna hit

359
00:21:20,022 --> 00:21:21,022
stop or go?
go

360
00:21:22,184 --> 00:21:23,184
warning rescinded

361
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:28,020
in that scenario, if I was the
pilot in command, I will continue

362
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,041
why

363
00:21:29,182 --> 00:21:30,862
it's not safety of flight

364
00:21:31,304 --> 00:21:32,304
145 rotate

365
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,962
when we hit 145
I call for major Link to rotate

366
00:21:38,619 --> 00:21:40,701
then it all very
quickly went to hell

367
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,083
they lift off

368
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,202
the flight control computer's
sensors are problem, so it pitches up

369
00:21:49,784 --> 00:21:51,184
pilots try to go nose down

370
00:21:52,299 --> 00:21:53,299
full power

371
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:56,101
they go max power but
the airplane is trying to stall

372
00:21:57,422 --> 00:22:00,260
major link is trying to push it
back down, but it wasn't working

373
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,260
it doesn't have any
effect in the plane

374
00:22:02,542 --> 00:22:04,442
we were basically
just belong for the ride

375
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,820
and then the left
wing just drops

376
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:10,662
and I know we're done

377
00:22:11,619 --> 00:22:12,619
we gotta get out

378
00:22:13,021 --> 00:22:14,701
then I pulled the handles

379
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:24,023
if the airplane did not
performed as advertise

380
00:22:24,381 --> 00:22:26,081
there was time
for them to get out

381
00:22:26,103 --> 00:22:27,785
and get the airplane
back to the tax payers

382
00:22:29,466 --> 00:22:30,466
thank you

383
00:22:30,906 --> 00:22:32,639
for your time today captain

384
00:22:32,681 --> 00:22:33,721
thank you sir

385
00:22:34,943 --> 00:22:37,943
they were extremely force
coming in their testimony

386
00:22:38,301 --> 00:22:39,301
they survived it

387
00:22:39,821 --> 00:22:42,381
but they had no understanding
of what happened either

388
00:22:45,703 --> 00:22:47,503
investigators need to know more

389
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,476
about the calibration that
grieve reported in his testimony

390
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:54,427
it's not part of the plane's
regular start up procedure

391
00:22:57,261 --> 00:23:00,668
if a sensor provides a reading
that differ significantly from others

392
00:23:01,445 --> 00:23:02,445
a recalibration is done

393
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,600
that tells the wayward
sensors how much they're off

394
00:23:05,945 --> 00:23:08,442
in order to bring them back
into agreement with the others

395
00:23:10,185 --> 00:23:12,185
these three were
just off by little

396
00:23:13,028 --> 00:23:14,028
they are way off

397
00:23:15,868 --> 00:23:18,920
and they need a very big adjustment
to get them align with the rest

398
00:23:20,385 --> 00:23:21,385
and were not sure why sir

399
00:23:25,466 --> 00:23:26,466
100 knots

400
00:23:27,022 --> 00:23:29,663
a master caution alarm

401
00:23:29,842 --> 00:23:32,262
that flickered on for a few
seconds just before take off

402
00:23:32,404 --> 00:23:34,004
becomes a key
piece of the puzzle

403
00:23:34,902 --> 00:23:36,502
at that point we
really didn't know

404
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:38,645
how they related but
we figured they might be

405
00:23:39,182 --> 00:23:42,728
there was too much coincidence starting
to happen that pointed to these things

406
00:23:43,145 --> 00:23:44,265
what was that?

407
00:23:44,863 --> 00:23:45,863
FCS caution

408
00:23:48,832 --> 00:23:51,262
3 calibrated sensors started
providing faulty data again

409
00:23:52,502 --> 00:23:53,502
six seconds later

410
00:23:54,503 --> 00:23:55,503
stop or go?
go

411
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:01,003
the flight computer resolve the discrepancy
between the sensors and cancel the warning

412
00:24:02,664 --> 00:24:04,464
what is going on with
this plane sensors?

413
00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:09,859
they have a mystery
flaw in the B-2

414
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:13,983
puts the 59th and the
air force under a lot of pressure

415
00:24:13,983 --> 00:24:18,506
they have to find out exactly what
went wrong with the flight controls

416
00:24:19,306 --> 00:24:22,721
in order to return that
fleet to safe operations

417
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:25,463
and the world will
be watching them

418
00:24:30,541 --> 00:24:31,541
okay

419
00:24:31,582 --> 00:24:32,582
so

420
00:24:32,862 --> 00:24:34,542
let's start at the top

421
00:24:35,424 --> 00:24:37,418
why they need to
recalibrate in the first place?

422
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,900
it was a procedure that a
lot of pilots had never seen

423
00:24:41,954 --> 00:24:43,654
and maintainers
didn't do very often

424
00:24:46,702 --> 00:24:49,800
investigators look for any
abnormalities in the mission

425
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:52,401
that might have had an
effect on the B-2 sensors

426
00:24:54,863 --> 00:24:55,863
hah

427
00:24:56,004 --> 00:24:57,004
so

428
00:24:57,499 --> 00:24:58,499
they got delayed by a day

429
00:25:00,263 --> 00:25:01,263
what it happened was?

430
00:25:01,421 --> 00:25:04,004
Whiteman Air Force Base in
Missouri had severe snow storm

431
00:25:04,823 --> 00:25:07,423
it was snowing quite heavily
visibility was near zero

432
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:12,099
so what we did is we delayed
the mission to come home

433
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:13,579
24 hours

434
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:18,040
spirit of Kansas was
left on the tarmac

435
00:25:18,181 --> 00:25:21,081
while the pilots waited
to resume the mission

436
00:25:24,382 --> 00:25:25,382
okay

437
00:25:26,223 --> 00:25:29,902
so the jet was left outside for
24 hours because of the delay

438
00:25:31,562 --> 00:25:32,562
so what

439
00:25:32,724 --> 00:25:34,084
check the weather

440
00:25:34,619 --> 00:25:35,619
second the last page

441
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,740
holy smokes

442
00:25:42,742 --> 00:25:44,442
that is one hell a lot of rain

443
00:25:48,104 --> 00:25:52,404
weather record showed that a tropical
rain storm settled over the airbase

444
00:25:52,581 --> 00:25:54,581
the night before the accident

445
00:25:56,743 --> 00:25:57,743
tell me

446
00:25:57,862 --> 00:26:00,600
rain storm didn't take down
a two billion dollar airplane

447
00:26:03,741 --> 00:26:08,258
decisions were made and
these B-2s were left outside

448
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,659
in this particularly
heavy rain storm

449
00:26:16,402 --> 00:26:17,402
okay

450
00:26:17,483 --> 00:26:18,483
let's flood these two

451
00:26:21,426 --> 00:26:23,426
investigators run
tests on B-2's sensors

452
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,693
to determine the effect
rain may have had on them

453
00:26:31,501 --> 00:26:32,501
and stop

454
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:36,820
gotta be kidding me

455
00:26:37,542 --> 00:26:40,900
tests confirmed that the sensors
exposed to the heaviest rain fall

456
00:26:41,419 --> 00:26:43,719
got saturated and
needed recalibrating

457
00:26:46,898 --> 00:26:47,898
even prior to that

458
00:26:48,381 --> 00:26:50,181
when it was in
test in development

459
00:26:50,262 --> 00:26:52,543
we've never experienced
that much rain on the system

460
00:26:53,344 --> 00:26:57,021
so no one really knew how
that would adversely effect

461
00:26:57,581 --> 00:26:59,581
the operations of the B-2

462
00:27:00,699 --> 00:27:03,761
the reason no one realize
how heavy rain effect the B-2

463
00:27:03,836 --> 00:27:07,161
is the it's almost always
parked inside a hanger

464
00:27:07,341 --> 00:27:10,241
at white man air
force base over night

465
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:13,906
even if it's flying a mission
over Afghanistan or Libyan

466
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,020
it returns to Missouri

467
00:27:20,663 --> 00:27:25,142
the B-2's occasional deployment to
Guam presented different weather conditions

468
00:27:26,862 --> 00:27:29,705
could heavy rain be the simple
explanation for this accident?

469
00:27:31,371 --> 00:27:34,061
this would not have happened
in a the desert environment

470
00:27:34,742 --> 00:27:36,742
this would not have
happened at whiteman

471
00:27:36,743 --> 00:27:37,743
but Guam is very unique

472
00:27:38,464 --> 00:27:40,585
they left the B-2 parked
out all night in the rain

473
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:42,026
the moisture got in there

474
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,760
see something
just doesn't add up

475
00:27:49,484 --> 00:27:50,984
they did the recalibration

476
00:27:52,578 --> 00:27:54,018
you good to go sir

477
00:27:54,861 --> 00:27:56,861
but they still ended
up with faulty data

478
00:27:57,423 --> 00:27:58,423
that nearly kill them

479
00:27:58,864 --> 00:27:59,864
yeah

480
00:28:01,426 --> 00:28:02,426
full power

481
00:28:03,426 --> 00:28:06,926
state of the art military
jet put itself into a stall

482
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,682
because it was getting faulty
data about its climb angle

483
00:28:10,782 --> 00:28:12,482
investigators still don't know why

484
00:28:14,939 --> 00:28:19,742
the B-2 is always operated under
so much pressure and scrutiny

485
00:28:20,583 --> 00:28:24,554
if they can’t figure out what
went wrong that day in Guam

486
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,320
honestly

487
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,041
this could be the end of
the B-2 bomber program

488
00:28:31,263 --> 00:28:32,263
okay

489
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,544
so

490
00:28:33,938 --> 00:28:35,938
they recalibrate at

491
00:28:37,061 --> 00:28:38,061
09:34

492
00:28:41,304 --> 00:28:42,304
nearly an hour later

493
00:28:43,862 --> 00:28:46,402
the master caution lights up
because of an air data issue

494
00:28:47,904 --> 00:28:48,904
so

495
00:28:49,059 --> 00:28:51,601
what happens in
those 56 minutes?

496
00:28:52,741 --> 00:28:55,772
investigators review what the
pilots told them about the flight

497
00:28:57,545 --> 00:28:58,545
routine taxi

498
00:28:59,547 --> 00:29:00,547
they hit the pitot heat

499
00:29:01,259 --> 00:29:02,259
wait for the timer

500
00:29:03,262 --> 00:29:04,262
and they're off

501
00:29:05,262 --> 00:29:06,262
so

502
00:29:09,464 --> 00:29:10,744
what about this?

503
00:29:14,179 --> 00:29:17,222
they are small heaters connected
to each of the plane's sensors

504
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,423
just before take off

505
00:29:19,864 --> 00:29:21,544
the pilots activate the heaters

506
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:22,986
so the sensors don't freeze up

507
00:29:23,085 --> 00:29:26,361
when the plane reaches cooler
temperature at higher altitudes

508
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:30,061
we can't take off advanced the
power and go down the runway

509
00:29:30,663 --> 00:29:32,282
until we put the pitot heat on

510
00:29:33,183 --> 00:29:34,463
pitot heat is on

511
00:29:34,635 --> 00:29:38,262
it's essential that those
sensors are getting heated

512
00:29:40,502 --> 00:29:43,002
investigators wonder
if the pitot heat

513
00:29:43,064 --> 00:29:45,964
could have effected
the recalibrated sensors

514
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,460
clear right

515
00:29:47,701 --> 00:29:48,741
go to line up

516
00:29:49,099 --> 00:29:51,138
we didn't know enough
to really put them together

517
00:29:51,579 --> 00:29:54,180
and so we had to go get better
understanding of the system

518
00:29:54,662 --> 00:29:56,662
and we did that
through engineers that

519
00:29:56,662 --> 00:29:58,182
actually build the system

520
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:02,922
he saw the frequency of our calibration
he was surprised and concerned

521
00:30:04,464 --> 00:30:05,464
and then

522
00:30:05,545 --> 00:30:08,079
they turn on pitot heat
when they get to the runway

523
00:30:08,859 --> 00:30:11,981
and then he was really
concerned when he saw

524
00:30:12,543 --> 00:30:15,143
and understood
like he only could

525
00:30:15,304 --> 00:30:18,140
that with moisture in the system
and the data we put into it to fix it

526
00:30:19,541 --> 00:30:21,541
could cause such a problem

527
00:30:22,664 --> 00:30:24,464
on the day of the accident

528
00:30:24,579 --> 00:30:27,742
turning on the pitot heat had a
consequence that no one anticipated

529
00:30:31,619 --> 00:30:35,602
recalibrating the sensors brought
the 3 wet ones in line with the others

530
00:30:36,423 --> 00:30:39,540
but turning on the pitot heat
boiled away the moisture

531
00:30:40,019 --> 00:30:41,702
bringing the sensors
back out of alignment

532
00:30:42,861 --> 00:30:43,861
first MCT

533
00:30:45,145 --> 00:30:48,445
so the data that was put in on
the calibration now, is invalid again

534
00:30:48,459 --> 00:30:51,943
and the flight computers now try to
resolve the issue with these sensors

535
00:30:53,811 --> 00:30:58,362
but the discovery doesn't explain
another key event, during short flight

536
00:31:02,265 --> 00:31:03,385
what was that?

537
00:31:03,985 --> 00:31:04,985
FCS caution

538
00:31:06,827 --> 00:31:11,060
why did the faulty air data warning
disappears 6 seconds after it came on?

539
00:31:13,262 --> 00:31:14,262
stop or go?

540
00:31:14,423 --> 00:31:15,423
go

541
00:31:15,544 --> 00:31:16,824
warning rescinded

542
00:31:24,221 --> 00:31:25,821
it's seconds from take off

543
00:31:26,504 --> 00:31:31,028
US air force investigators looking to
the logic guiding the B-2's flight computer

544
00:31:32,419 --> 00:31:33,919
so it has to make choice

545
00:31:34,943 --> 00:31:36,663
the flight data computer
needs a solution

546
00:31:37,503 --> 00:31:39,003
and what we mean by that is

547
00:31:39,504 --> 00:31:41,599
it can't spend even a
second or a milliseconds

548
00:31:43,179 --> 00:31:45,179
wondering where it is?
and what needs to be done?

549
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:51,663
the B-2's flight computer is constantly
receiving four separate data stream

550
00:31:52,499 --> 00:31:53,499
from all 24 sensors

551
00:31:54,821 --> 00:31:57,380
if there is a discrepancy in
the values of those channels

552
00:31:58,178 --> 00:32:02,702
the computer is programmed to
select any two of the channels to proceed

553
00:32:05,785 --> 00:32:06,785
it just chose wrong

554
00:32:08,906 --> 00:32:09,906
yeah, we should fix that

555
00:32:10,579 --> 00:32:12,979
it's not voting is to
throw out bad data

556
00:32:13,142 --> 00:32:15,342
what they think is bad data
keep the good data

557
00:32:15,422 --> 00:32:16,422
and it resolves the issue

558
00:32:17,104 --> 00:32:18,104
the light goes away

559
00:32:18,264 --> 00:32:19,918
the flight computers
are now good to go

560
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,701
and so the pilots are now, okay
well that must just have been a glitch

561
00:32:24,782 --> 00:32:25,782
let's keep going

562
00:32:25,943 --> 00:32:26,943
stop or go?

563
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:28,179
go
warning rescinded

564
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:33,824
the flight computers chose the two channels
that included the faulty sensor data

565
00:32:35,905 --> 00:32:36,905
145
rotate

566
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,140
12 seconds later

567
00:32:42,183 --> 00:32:43,683
the plane pitched up abnormally

568
00:32:43,904 --> 00:32:45,904
because of the faulty
air data readings

569
00:32:47,539 --> 00:32:51,781
once they rotated the aircraft
on speed as they thought

570
00:32:51,782 --> 00:32:52,782
and left the ground

571
00:32:53,223 --> 00:32:54,823
they along for the
ride at that point

572
00:32:55,784 --> 00:32:59,420
but if we calibrating the plane's
sensors before turning on the pitot heat

573
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,260
can be catastrophic

574
00:33:02,542 --> 00:33:04,624
why was that the
official procedure?

575
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,120
so hardly any of all that

576
00:33:10,699 --> 00:33:13,899
investigators learn that
recalibration are rarely done

577
00:33:14,062 --> 00:33:16,462
while the B-2 is at its
home base in Missouri

578
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,181
but during a deployment
in Guam in 2006

579
00:33:22,582 --> 00:33:25,340
maintenance personnel were
performing frequent recalibration

580
00:33:27,381 --> 00:33:28,381
copy that
I'm on my way

581
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:32,820
they knew there was a challenge
bu they didn't what it was

582
00:33:32,901 --> 00:33:35,950
and they did speculate that
because of the weather in Guam

583
00:33:36,541 --> 00:33:38,541
raining a lot more than at home

584
00:33:39,103 --> 00:33:41,103
that it might be an
issue of moisture

585
00:33:43,061 --> 00:33:45,743
technicians in Guam spoke
to an engineer in the US

586
00:33:46,703 --> 00:33:50,225
who suggested a procedure to
remedy the frequent air data calibrations

587
00:33:51,786 --> 00:33:54,318
yeah, then we have to do
an on-board recalibration

588
00:33:56,822 --> 00:33:58,922
they were able to talk
to an engineer that said

589
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:01,340
well before you do
a data calibration

590
00:34:01,402 --> 00:34:03,302
try turning on the pitot heat

591
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:06,019
and burning that
water out of the system

592
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,940
and see if that
will take care of it

593
00:34:07,941 --> 00:34:09,941
I haven't tried that
good idea though

594
00:34:12,181 --> 00:34:14,181
the technician passed
on the suggestion

595
00:34:14,701 --> 00:34:15,701
to the B-2 pilots in Guam

596
00:34:17,223 --> 00:34:19,580
try turning on your pitot
heat before your second step

597
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:21,660
copy

598
00:34:22,902 --> 00:34:24,402
apparently I should do it

599
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:30,942
yep, but

600
00:34:31,382 --> 00:34:33,062
our guys didn't do that

601
00:34:33,664 --> 00:34:35,264
can you think of a reason why?

602
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:40,081
investigators learned from
technicians at Whiteman Air Force Base

603
00:34:40,102 --> 00:34:42,659
that the procedure
for activating pitot heat

604
00:34:42,784 --> 00:34:45,384
in response to an air-data
calibration message

605
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,940
was not officially adopted

606
00:34:48,822 --> 00:34:49,822
really

607
00:34:51,184 --> 00:34:52,184
why the heck not?

608
00:34:53,461 --> 00:34:54,961
some crews knew about it

609
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,460
some did not

610
00:34:57,185 --> 00:34:58,985
pilots back in whiteman
who were not there

611
00:34:59,024 --> 00:35:01,865
never heard of it and
maintainers had never heard of it

612
00:35:11,064 --> 00:35:12,064
there is nothing

613
00:35:12,786 --> 00:35:17,521
there is nothing anywhere about using pitot
heat when a calibration message appears

614
00:35:23,185 --> 00:35:24,625
you good to go sir

615
00:35:24,898 --> 00:35:27,098
neither Ryan Link
Justin Grieve

616
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,400
nor the maintainer
assigned to their plane

617
00:35:29,583 --> 00:35:31,883
was ever told about
the moisture issue

618
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:34,301
or the informal
procedure for rectifying it

619
00:35:34,942 --> 00:35:35,942
better

620
00:35:36,902 --> 00:35:38,102
yeah looks good

621
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,581
the maintainers that morning
were following the tech orders

622
00:35:43,142 --> 00:35:44,642
which tell them
exactly what to do

623
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,143
in the preflight

624
00:35:46,585 --> 00:35:47,585
but for some reason

625
00:35:48,024 --> 00:35:50,260
this new work around to
compensate for the moisture

626
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,600
just hadn't made
it into the manual

627
00:35:53,899 --> 00:35:55,520
and that's a
little bit of tragedy

628
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:57,822
so

629
00:35:57,862 --> 00:35:59,362
these three are wrong

630
00:36:00,423 --> 00:36:02,939
what if they used pitot
heat instead of recalibrating?

631
00:36:05,221 --> 00:36:07,243
they would have burned
off the excess moisture

632
00:36:08,059 --> 00:36:09,559
that solved the problem

633
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:11,801
no faulty air data

634
00:36:12,862 --> 00:36:13,862
no accident

635
00:36:14,858 --> 00:36:17,740
if information had been shared
from previous deployment 2006

636
00:36:18,662 --> 00:36:19,662
to 2008

637
00:36:20,102 --> 00:36:22,102
this accident could
have been prevented

638
00:36:23,224 --> 00:36:25,124
hey chief for seeing
an air data cal message

639
00:36:25,139 --> 00:36:27,299
can you send someone
up here to clear that up?

640
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:30,242
the maintenance personnel that
came out to the aircraft that day

641
00:36:30,739 --> 00:36:31,939
of the accident

642
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,780
did everything exactly right

643
00:36:33,901 --> 00:36:36,382
they were just doing the
procedure they were taught

644
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:41,440
it doesn't seem like
anybody understood

645
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,341
what this recalibration could do

646
00:36:45,424 --> 00:36:48,685
the investigation has
uncovered the catastrophic gap

647
00:36:48,779 --> 00:36:51,179
in the B-2 crews
understanding of the link

648
00:36:51,341 --> 00:36:53,341
between calibrating sensors

649
00:36:53,341 --> 00:36:54,781
and flight controls

650
00:36:55,584 --> 00:36:56,584
145
rotate

651
00:36:57,225 --> 00:37:01,639
there is no way a pilot or a maintainer
would understand the system well enough

652
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:04,261
to realize what
could have happened

653
00:37:04,824 --> 00:37:06,524
and they did that
data calibration

654
00:37:07,385 --> 00:37:10,460
that lack of understanding
left the crew of spirit of Kansas

655
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:13,241
vulnerable to the
effects of the faulty data

656
00:37:15,539 --> 00:37:16,539
investigators now wonder

657
00:37:16,981 --> 00:37:21,733
if there was something that pilots
could have done to save their plane

658
00:37:27,899 --> 00:37:28,899
18 seconds

659
00:37:29,621 --> 00:37:31,121
to get this plane
under control

660
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:34,543
was it even possible?

661
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,101
investigators reexamine
the crash sequence

662
00:37:38,662 --> 00:37:41,423
to see if the pilots of the
B-2 bomber spirit of Kansas

663
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:45,580
could have prevented their
aircraft from crashing at Guam?

664
00:37:47,422 --> 00:37:48,422
145
rotate

665
00:37:50,945 --> 00:37:51,945
certainly

666
00:37:52,506 --> 00:37:56,818
no B-2 pilot wanted to be
the first to eject from a B-2

667
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,040
plane goes full nose up

668
00:38:02,624 --> 00:38:04,124
he pushes full forward

669
00:38:04,625 --> 00:38:05,625
and goes full power

670
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:12,621
plane starts rolling left

671
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,700
he applies right stick

672
00:38:17,542 --> 00:38:18,582
he's fighting

673
00:38:19,544 --> 00:38:22,906
investigators determine that
major link took the correct action

674
00:38:23,506 --> 00:38:24,506
to save the B-2 bomber

675
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:30,100
but because of its low
altitude and slow speed

676
00:38:30,263 --> 00:38:31,763
disaster was unavoidable

677
00:38:33,385 --> 00:38:35,939
ultimately this was a no
win situation with the crew

678
00:38:37,059 --> 00:38:38,559
as we determine

679
00:38:39,062 --> 00:38:41,142
with hundreds and hundreds
of simulations afterwards

680
00:38:41,623 --> 00:38:45,306
no one could have flown
this aircraft out of that situation

681
00:38:50,021 --> 00:38:54,718
the data also shows just how close
the pilots came to losing their lives

682
00:38:56,461 --> 00:38:58,261
they are seconds
away from impact

683
00:38:59,023 --> 00:39:00,023
and

684
00:39:00,698 --> 00:39:02,398
they still hadn't
pulled the handle

685
00:39:02,481 --> 00:39:05,021
if they had delayed even
a fraction of second later

686
00:39:05,582 --> 00:39:06,582
to eject

687
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:10,305
they both likely would
not have survived

688
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:15,400
the video of the accident
shows that the plane's left wing

689
00:39:15,461 --> 00:39:18,503
was already scraping the
ground when the pilots ejected

690
00:39:21,105 --> 00:39:22,105
we've gotta get out

691
00:39:32,618 --> 00:39:34,118
they're heroes in the sense that

692
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:36,619
there guys waited to the
very last possible second

693
00:39:37,783 --> 00:39:40,340
I don't know if many other
people that can say that they waited

694
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,820
till the wing tip hit the
ground before ejecting

695
00:39:44,021 --> 00:39:45,021
can you imagine that?

696
00:39:46,299 --> 00:39:48,381
all pilots in the
air force are good

697
00:39:48,531 --> 00:39:49,531
or maybe great

698
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:53,062
but these guys were
truly outstanding

699
00:39:53,383 --> 00:39:56,383
and they were very very close
despite everything

700
00:39:57,541 --> 00:39:59,141
to actually saving that aircraft

701
00:40:01,784 --> 00:40:04,646
one of the most sophisticated
warplanes on earth

702
00:40:04,905 --> 00:40:07,085
was brought down by a
combination of poor whether

703
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,380
who would have guessed

704
00:40:09,381 --> 00:40:11,381
that a little bit of moisture

705
00:40:11,382 --> 00:40:12,815
would have led to all theses

706
00:40:12,818 --> 00:40:14,418
and poor communications

707
00:40:14,499 --> 00:40:16,499
which left Grieve and Link
without understanding

708
00:40:16,979 --> 00:40:18,679
recalibrating their sensors

709
00:40:19,221 --> 00:40:21,161
could lead to a serious
flight control issue

710
00:40:23,701 --> 00:40:24,701
100 knots

711
00:40:26,662 --> 00:40:28,950
this accident didn't
happened because of bad data

712
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,000
not because of bad software

713
00:40:31,501 --> 00:40:33,001
not because of bad weather

714
00:40:33,141 --> 00:40:34,941
not because of
bad decision making

715
00:40:35,983 --> 00:40:37,983
it happened because
of bad communication

716
00:40:39,667 --> 00:40:41,267
in the end safety is everything

717
00:40:42,219 --> 00:40:44,219
it doesn't matter
if it's an airliner

718
00:40:44,501 --> 00:40:45,541
a fighter jet

719
00:40:45,942 --> 00:40:47,442
a space plane or stealth bomber

720
00:40:48,184 --> 00:40:49,184
full power

721
00:40:49,205 --> 00:40:53,301
safety is critical and safety
depends on communication

722
00:40:55,983 --> 00:40:59,183
the air force investigation
underscores the need for pilots

723
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:02,742
to be kept informed about their
technology controlling their airplanes

724
00:41:05,264 --> 00:41:06,264
do really really

725
00:41:07,266 --> 00:41:10,346
wanted to leave the defense of your
families your children your grand children

726
00:41:11,461 --> 00:41:12,501
to a computer

727
00:41:13,303 --> 00:41:16,945
or do you want to leave it to
the brightest asset that we have

728
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:20,180
and that is the human brain

729
00:41:22,822 --> 00:41:26,780
in spite of being involved in the most
expensive aviation disaster in history

730
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:30,320
Major Ryan Link and
Captain Justin Grieve

731
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:32,861
went on to have
successful military careers

732
00:41:34,138 --> 00:41:36,638
the B-2 was back in the air
two month after the crash

733
00:41:37,821 --> 00:41:39,821
the flight computer
was redesigned

734
00:41:40,102 --> 00:41:41,602
to prevent faulty air data

735
00:41:44,626 --> 00:41:48,240
the procedure for using pitot heat
instead of recalibrating the sensors

736
00:41:49,058 --> 00:41:52,058
is documented in air force
manuals and technical documents

737
00:41:54,423 --> 00:41:57,023
there hasn't been an issue
with faulty air data since

738
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:01,225
Northrop produced
an amazing aircraft

739
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:03,740
then I commend them
and the maintainers

740
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:06,101
and the aviators that
continue to make the B-2

741
00:42:07,219 --> 00:42:09,299
the envy to the world
