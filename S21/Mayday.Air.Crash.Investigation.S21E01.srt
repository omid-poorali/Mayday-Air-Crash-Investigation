1
00:00:01,943 --> 00:00:04,643
staring down a thunderstorm
above the north sea

2
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:06,459
take a look at that

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,100
I don't like it

4
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:11,261
a modern turboprop is struck
by more than a million volts

5
00:00:14,258 --> 00:00:15,358
after the lightening strike

6
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:17,139
you obviously looking to see

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,720
have we been damaged?

8
00:00:18,782 --> 00:00:20,382
damn it
the plan is not responding

9
00:00:21,263 --> 00:00:23,163
you can fly an aircraft
without a compass

10
00:00:23,184 --> 00:00:25,184
you can fly an
aircraft without a radio

11
00:00:25,187 --> 00:00:28,527
mayday mayday, we've been struck by
lightening and having control difficulties

12
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:31,340
you can't fly an aircraft
without functioning controls

13
00:00:31,662 --> 00:00:33,962
but investigators can't
figured out how lightening

14
00:00:34,143 --> 00:00:37,171
could have caused the
plane to behave the way it did

15
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,220
look at that

16
00:00:38,261 --> 00:00:41,342
I mean the elevators are trying to
get the nose to pitch down instead of up

17
00:00:41,938 --> 00:00:43,838
you're not come
across an aircraft where

18
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,567
there will be a this difference
between the pilot input

19
00:00:46,703 --> 00:00:49,370
and what the aircraft
was actually doing

20
00:00:49,544 --> 00:00:50,544
oh no

21
00:00:50,545 --> 00:00:51,665
we're dropping

22
00:00:52,267 --> 00:00:53,867
so distracted by that

23
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:56,939
they failed to see what
was really going on

24
00:01:24,379 --> 00:01:25,879
it's 6:45 pm

25
00:01:28,022 --> 00:01:30,022
Logan air Flight 6780

26
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:32,023
cruises over the
north sea near Scotland

27
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,429
let's get lower

28
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:39,519
request flight level 110 please

29
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,480
approach
Logan air Flight 6780

30
00:01:42,863 --> 00:01:44,543
requesting descent to 110

31
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,340
6780
descent to 110

32
00:01:49,262 --> 00:01:52,664
the plane is more than half
way through a 65 minute flight

33
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:59,388
most of the passengers
live on the Shetland islands

34
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:01,479
are you done?
yes thank you

35
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,820
I'll take that

36
00:02:03,142 --> 00:02:05,703
many are returning home from
holiday shopping in Aberdeen

37
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:09,420
air travel is massively
important to residents of Shetland

38
00:02:12,463 --> 00:02:14,263
it's important for work meetings

39
00:02:14,703 --> 00:02:17,203
it's important for sporting
events, for holidays

40
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:20,221
and it's the fastest
way to travel off island

41
00:02:20,303 --> 00:02:22,436
and so it's quick and convenient

42
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:25,659
the captain is experienced

43
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,880
he has more than
5000 flying hours

44
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:30,983
and is the pilot flying tonight

45
00:02:32,788 --> 00:02:33,788
passing flight level 150

46
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:39,864
the first officer is monitoring the
instruments and handling all communications

47
00:02:39,864 --> 00:02:41,664
approach
Logan 6780

48
00:02:42,064 --> 00:02:44,064
descending to flight level 150

49
00:02:44,346 --> 00:02:45,346
for the IRS
runway 27

50
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,860
she has more than
1000 flying hours

51
00:02:51,143 --> 00:02:53,143
Koei had a good total experience

52
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:57,222
of course they didn't have a lot
of experience flying up to 2000

53
00:02:57,322 --> 00:02:58,322
but still

54
00:02:58,403 --> 00:03:00,536
it was a normal experienced crew

55
00:03:02,305 --> 00:03:06,259
the Saab 2000 is twin
engine high speed turboprop

56
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:11,062
it's plane that aviation analyst
Hans Peter Graf knows extremely well

57
00:03:11,623 --> 00:03:15,023
the Saab 2000 is the
most advanced turboprop

58
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,720
still existing and flying

59
00:03:18,623 --> 00:03:20,223
it has suchlike performance

60
00:03:20,864 --> 00:03:22,664
paired with low fuel consumption

61
00:03:24,339 --> 00:03:28,239
and it had real good
performance to fly in and out of a

62
00:03:28,302 --> 00:03:29,302
mountainous terrain

63
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:33,083
they're traveling north
from Aberdeen Scotland

64
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:35,419
to Sumburgh on
the Shetland islands

65
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,500
a remote archipelago
prone to winter swells

66
00:03:38,543 --> 00:03:39,543
and even hurricane

67
00:03:45,022 --> 00:03:46,522
Logan air 6780

68
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,360
for your information looks like
the ATIS antenna at Sumburgh

69
00:03:50,382 --> 00:03:53,403
has been struck by lightening
so this seems no functioning

70
00:03:53,665 --> 00:03:55,665
I look the conditions
when I get them

71
00:03:56,067 --> 00:03:57,067
okay
6780

72
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,060
it's been a lot of
that so far this winter

73
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:05,342
the ATIS or automatic
terminal information service

74
00:04:05,418 --> 00:04:09,061
provides pilots with continues
broadcast of essential information

75
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:14,500
it broadcasts weather and reports
information every 30 minutes

76
00:04:16,101 --> 00:04:20,363
on which the pilots will base
era approaches and landings

77
00:04:22,025 --> 00:04:23,525
I need your ATIS anyway

78
00:04:26,821 --> 00:04:28,421
Sumburgh information Tango

79
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:33,480
winds 290 at 34
gusting 47, visibility

80
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:36,139
I guessed you're
gonna get fight after all

81
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,140
gusting 47

82
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,602
it's gonna get a bit
rough on the way down

83
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:45,341
the wind at Sumburgh airport
are blowing up to 47 knots

84
00:04:46,224 --> 00:04:47,224
54 miles an hour

85
00:04:49,626 --> 00:04:52,727
thee crew will be facing strong
gale force winds while landing

86
00:04:58,901 --> 00:05:01,001
I traveled by a lot
when it does go windy

87
00:05:01,422 --> 00:05:04,222
we would expect now a little bit
of turbulence on the way we knew

88
00:05:04,244 --> 00:05:05,944
flight of that size
it's a small flight

89
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,180
you do feel and

90
00:05:07,581 --> 00:05:10,001
turbulence more than what
you're within a bigger plane

91
00:05:10,103 --> 00:05:11,703
and but it was nothing unusual

92
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:16,063
the captain wants to be ready for
any unpredictable weather thrown up

93
00:05:16,822 --> 00:05:18,822
let's brief in case
of a lightning strike

94
00:05:19,343 --> 00:05:20,463
copy that
okay

95
00:05:20,464 --> 00:05:21,464
right

96
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:24,225
instruments lights are full
in case we have blinded

97
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,299
torches are here
and here on your side

98
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,480
and the emergency elevator
trim switch is over head

99
00:05:29,823 --> 00:05:30,863
any question?

100
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:32,264
no questions

101
00:05:32,425 --> 00:05:33,701
statistics suggest that

102
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:37,636
a particular aircraft would
probably get a lightening strike

103
00:05:37,641 --> 00:05:39,141
about 1.5 times a year

104
00:05:41,065 --> 00:05:43,165
you don't know when
it's coming of course and

105
00:05:43,618 --> 00:05:45,618
the thing you're
aware of is that

106
00:05:45,901 --> 00:05:47,501
these lightening strikes can

107
00:05:47,621 --> 00:05:51,141
affects the electronics and
the avionics in the aircraft

108
00:05:52,658 --> 00:05:53,658
Logan air 6780

109
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,380
flight heading 355

110
00:05:57,222 --> 00:05:59,222
ATIS weather from
Sumburgh visibility

111
00:05:59,783 --> 00:06:00,783
3300 now

112
00:06:01,184 --> 00:06:04,184
while there are rain and snow
runway is wet

113
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,480
Logan air Flight 6780
got the weather, thanks

114
00:06:09,344 --> 00:06:10,344
slow it down to 205

115
00:06:11,627 --> 00:06:12,627
roger that

116
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:18,081
the crew prepares the plane
for the turbulence ahead

117
00:06:19,183 --> 00:06:21,183
let's get them
buckled in back there

118
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:31,222
16 miles from Sumburgh airport

119
00:06:31,704 --> 00:06:35,667
flight 6780 turns onto its
final approach to the runway

120
00:06:47,983 --> 00:06:48,983
take a look at that

121
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:54,339
I don't like it

122
00:06:55,901 --> 00:06:58,901
there is some bad weather
developing of the end of the runway

123
00:06:59,264 --> 00:07:00,764
approach
Logan air 6780

124
00:07:01,265 --> 00:07:03,999
as big storm set on
radar just of the runway

125
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,060
I need to discontinue

126
00:07:05,981 --> 00:07:06,981
6780
roger

127
00:07:08,183 --> 00:07:09,183
let me know

128
00:07:09,544 --> 00:07:11,544
all crews going into an airfield

129
00:07:12,104 --> 00:07:14,204
in these source of conditions
will be

130
00:07:14,661 --> 00:07:17,461
vary of the thunderstorms
activity around them

131
00:07:19,703 --> 00:07:21,703
the pilots consider
their options

132
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,026
how much fuels we have left?

133
00:07:25,508 --> 00:07:26,508
2500 kilos

134
00:07:26,898 --> 00:07:28,798
do you want to head
back to Aberdeen?

135
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,860
I want to circle

136
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,660
making another attempt

137
00:07:33,783 --> 00:07:39,638
they abandoned the approach when they saw
a lot of precipitation on the weather radar

138
00:07:39,741 --> 00:07:40,741
just ahead of them

139
00:07:42,303 --> 00:07:44,303
updrafts, downdrafts, wind shears

140
00:07:45,104 --> 00:07:46,104
which are not predictable

141
00:07:46,819 --> 00:07:50,521
so you better go around and
wait or divert to another airport

142
00:07:51,343 --> 00:07:53,343
Logan 6780
we're gonna circle around

143
00:07:53,624 --> 00:07:54,624
turning 180 for now

144
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,860
6780
understood

145
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,580
maintain 2000

146
00:08:00,142 --> 00:08:01,642
he obviously made the decision

147
00:08:01,823 --> 00:08:05,265
that at that time he would
just turn away from the airfield

148
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:07,981
and properly allow that
weather to passed through

149
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:10,021
and then have another approach

150
00:08:16,461 --> 00:08:19,141
as the pilot circled for
another landing attempt

151
00:08:23,467 --> 00:08:24,467
crap

152
00:08:28,061 --> 00:08:29,061
it sounded like a gunshot

153
00:08:30,064 --> 00:08:32,564
it was just a very
short sharp noise

154
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:34,146
and flash

155
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,680
I thought at that point that it was
something that happened to the engines

156
00:08:38,262 --> 00:08:40,962
if you experience a
lightening especially at night

157
00:08:41,384 --> 00:08:42,884
it's a very bright light

158
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:44,665
you can smell a burnt smell

159
00:08:45,619 --> 00:08:46,619
ozone smell and

160
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:49,261
that sure is
frightening or fearsome

161
00:08:50,944 --> 00:08:51,944
to every crew

162
00:08:53,505 --> 00:08:55,205
circuit breaker looks fine

163
00:08:55,506 --> 00:08:58,306
after the lightening strike
you obviously looking to see

164
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,520
have we been damaged?

165
00:09:00,222 --> 00:09:02,222
are the instruments
do working correctly?

166
00:09:04,985 --> 00:09:05,985
but something is wrong

167
00:09:07,267 --> 00:09:08,267
controls feel very heavy

168
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:12,349
damn it
the plane isn't responding

169
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,460
there must be a
degree of panic will set in

170
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,383
when the controls
are just not responding

171
00:09:20,465 --> 00:09:21,465
plane isn't responding

172
00:09:21,506 --> 00:09:23,506
mayday mayday
this is Logan air 6780

173
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,547
we've been struck by lightening
and having control difficulties

174
00:09:26,622 --> 00:09:27,622
please clear the airspace

175
00:09:29,979 --> 00:09:32,079
I knew that there is
definitely something not right

176
00:09:33,382 --> 00:09:34,382
I was terrified

177
00:09:40,419 --> 00:09:43,419
Logan air flight
6780 is in distress

178
00:09:43,502 --> 00:09:45,502
2000 feet above the north sea

179
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,740
mayday mayday
this is Logan air 6780

180
00:09:48,859 --> 00:09:50,539
please clear the airspace

181
00:09:50,862 --> 00:09:51,862
6780
copy

182
00:09:52,302 --> 00:09:55,374
if you can
Say Souls on Board and Fuel Remaining

183
00:09:56,801 --> 00:09:59,401
33 people on board
2500 kg of fuel

184
00:09:59,942 --> 00:10:00,942
copy

185
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:04,782
all options are available
do you want to land or divert?

186
00:10:05,862 --> 00:10:08,062
without knowing what's
wrong with the plane

187
00:10:08,425 --> 00:10:09,425
that's really fighting me

188
00:10:10,425 --> 00:10:13,525
it's too risky to attempt landing
in a storm at Sumburgh airport

189
00:10:15,219 --> 00:10:17,419
we should divert back to
Aberdeen, better conditions

190
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,420
agree

191
00:10:18,581 --> 00:10:20,581
Aberdeen airport
is 190 miles away

192
00:10:21,703 --> 00:10:23,703
let's try climbing to 4000

193
00:10:24,826 --> 00:10:26,926
6780 we're going to
divert back to Aberdeen

194
00:10:28,459 --> 00:10:29,459
something is wrong

195
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,300
I can't get the plane to climb
how's your side?

196
00:10:33,864 --> 00:10:34,864
it's really heavy

197
00:10:37,546 --> 00:10:39,546
trims aren't doing
anything either

198
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,641
if you grab on the yoke and
the airplane isn't responding

199
00:10:43,021 --> 00:10:46,064
they realize something is wrong
we need to do something

200
00:10:51,461 --> 00:10:53,461
finally the crew
catches a small break

201
00:10:55,704 --> 00:10:56,704
altitude is increasing

202
00:10:57,826 --> 00:10:58,826
keep on it

203
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,060
the plane is climbing

204
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,500
but not as quickly
as it should be

205
00:11:06,463 --> 00:11:08,483
the elevators might be damaged

206
00:11:09,266 --> 00:11:12,400
in two minutes the plane
has barely climb 2000 feet

207
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:17,183
the first officer worries the lightening
strike may have disabled their instruments

208
00:11:18,264 --> 00:11:19,264
Aberdeen
6780

209
00:11:19,985 --> 00:11:21,585
what's our altitude?

210
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,540
I saw you approaching 4000 feet

211
00:11:25,903 --> 00:11:29,305
but the controller is getting the
exact same reading as the crew

212
00:11:31,265 --> 00:11:33,265
we really not go anywhere fast

213
00:11:33,508 --> 00:11:36,108
pull
I'm almost all the back

214
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,620
let's face it

215
00:11:37,642 --> 00:11:39,242
you can fly an aircraft
without compass

216
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:41,282
you can fly an
aircraft without a radio

217
00:11:41,545 --> 00:11:44,625
but you can't fly an aircraft
without functioning controls

218
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,788
and then the unthinkable happens

219
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,260
oh no
come on

220
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,780
we're dropping

221
00:11:55,463 --> 00:11:58,805
flight 6078 plunges
uncontrollably towards the north sea

222
00:12:00,842 --> 00:12:02,742
the flight went
into that nose dive so

223
00:12:02,782 --> 00:12:04,182
we knew immediately that

224
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,323
that something wasn't
right with the plane

225
00:12:09,544 --> 00:12:10,544
6078

226
00:12:10,867 --> 00:12:11,867
that's your height now

227
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,540
600

228
00:12:14,225 --> 00:12:15,225
3400

229
00:12:16,345 --> 00:12:18,545
the pilots wrestle
with their controls

230
00:12:18,587 --> 00:12:22,650
as the planes speed towards
the water at 350 miles an hour

231
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,860
you're descending

232
00:12:26,021 --> 00:12:27,021
2000 feet

233
00:12:27,463 --> 00:12:28,463
1800 feet

234
00:12:32,268 --> 00:12:33,268
dive was so fast

235
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:35,909
you just felt like your
heart was your mouth

236
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,480
I had no idea how
close we were to the sea

237
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:41,041
you couldn't see anything
that was just pitch black

238
00:12:42,738 --> 00:12:44,538
it was terrifying
it was really scary

239
00:12:46,661 --> 00:12:47,661
1500

240
00:12:48,343 --> 00:12:49,703
you're descending

241
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:51,904
nothings working

242
00:12:52,345 --> 00:12:53,345
come on

243
00:12:59,063 --> 00:13:02,604
the airplane is less than
10 seconds from impact

244
00:13:04,707 --> 00:13:06,707
must be incredibly frightening

245
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,262
because the pilots would
be aware of rate of decent

246
00:13:09,621 --> 00:13:11,621
the would have
be aware of altitude

247
00:13:11,903 --> 00:13:14,465
and they would be aware
of how much time left they had

248
00:13:15,025 --> 00:13:16,025
to fatal recovery

249
00:13:16,467 --> 00:13:17,467
1100

250
00:13:18,587 --> 00:13:19,587
speeds
speeds

251
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,883
in a last ditch effort
to save the plane

252
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,120
the captain increases
engine power

253
00:13:34,461 --> 00:13:35,461
we're climbing

254
00:13:37,864 --> 00:13:41,206
some increase in the power may increase
the amount of airflow over the wings

255
00:13:41,267 --> 00:13:42,967
and give a little bit more lift

256
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,120
to allow the aircraft to
pull out of its descent

257
00:13:49,463 --> 00:13:51,063
we were traveling at such speed

258
00:13:51,145 --> 00:13:53,845
that when the plane started
pulling up again it was a

259
00:13:53,987 --> 00:13:56,838
kind of sensation of
being on a roller coaster

260
00:13:57,659 --> 00:14:01,622
it was definitely a relief to start
climbing after that nose pitch

261
00:14:02,743 --> 00:14:04,743
the pilots have avoided
near catastrophe

262
00:14:06,426 --> 00:14:09,479
but now they need to get their
plane back to Aberdeen safely

263
00:14:10,659 --> 00:14:13,059
in the moments after that we had

264
00:14:13,062 --> 00:14:14,862
a period of just
terrible turbulence

265
00:14:15,344 --> 00:14:17,344
much turbulence
I've ever experienced

266
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,959
the man behind me start vomiting

267
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,640
it was kind of a flight
was quiet though

268
00:14:24,702 --> 00:14:25,702
was kind of quiet

269
00:14:26,663 --> 00:14:28,363
requesting flight level 240

270
00:14:28,939 --> 00:14:29,939
6078
roger

271
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,660
climb and maintain 240

272
00:14:36,305 --> 00:14:38,305
controls are looking better now

273
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:45,711
ladies and gentleman
this is the captain

274
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,980
it was at that point
the pilot came on and

275
00:14:47,981 --> 00:14:49,981
told us we've been struck
by lightening and we were

276
00:14:49,982 --> 00:14:51,982
we were heading back to Aberdeen

277
00:14:51,983 --> 00:14:53,983
we had some
flight control issues

278
00:14:54,545 --> 00:14:56,545
everything is under control now

279
00:14:56,547 --> 00:14:58,547
we'll be landing in
Aberdeen in 15 minutes

280
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:03,043
and please expect to see some emergency
services on the ground when we land

281
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:06,503
not to panic
it's just standard precaution

282
00:15:07,859 --> 00:15:08,859
thank you

283
00:15:09,421 --> 00:15:11,421
you go through moment like that

284
00:15:12,262 --> 00:15:14,283
yeah, you panic until
you're on the ground

285
00:15:18,867 --> 00:15:20,867
let's fly a straighter approach

286
00:15:21,901 --> 00:15:23,960
I'm get this plane on the
ground as soon as possible

287
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:33,299
the pilots of Logan
air flight 6078

288
00:15:33,461 --> 00:15:36,823
are on final approach
to Aberdeen airport

289
00:15:37,704 --> 00:15:38,704
Aberdeen
6078

290
00:15:39,344 --> 00:15:41,344
establish on the localizer
runway 16

291
00:15:42,739 --> 00:15:44,839
not knowing which
instruments they can trust

292
00:15:45,301 --> 00:15:47,801
the pilots carefully
configure the plane for landing

293
00:15:48,983 --> 00:15:49,983
flaps 35

294
00:15:52,228 --> 00:15:53,228
flaps 35

295
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,630
controls feel normal

296
00:15:56,753 --> 00:15:58,753
having avoided
disaster twice already

297
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,362
their soul focus is to get the
plane safely on the ground

298
00:16:03,219 --> 00:16:04,219
130

299
00:16:04,581 --> 00:16:05,581
speed looks good

300
00:16:06,261 --> 00:16:07,261
decision height

301
00:16:08,263 --> 00:16:09,263
on my side
continue

302
00:16:10,818 --> 00:16:14,400
the pilot came on and told us
we'd be expected a normal landing

303
00:16:14,502 --> 00:16:16,702
but the emergency services
would be on the runway

304
00:16:16,783 --> 00:16:18,861
we want to be alarmed
if we saw the lights

305
00:16:31,819 --> 00:16:32,819
all right

306
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,880
50 knots
coming out of reverse

307
00:16:35,421 --> 00:16:36,421
checked

308
00:16:39,345 --> 00:16:41,345
the landing was
smooth in Aberdeen

309
00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:44,201
I was just glad that
we were on the ground

310
00:16:44,701 --> 00:16:46,701
happy to be on solid ground

311
00:16:47,543 --> 00:16:48,543
me too

312
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:49,930
I brushed into tears

313
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:52,819
it was relief more
probably than anything

314
00:16:53,621 --> 00:16:55,621
a little bit of
shock probably too

315
00:17:01,219 --> 00:17:05,923
it's up to investigators at the air
accidents investigation branch (AAIB)

316
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,583
to figure out what went wrong

317
00:17:10,741 --> 00:17:14,140
David Miller is the deputy
chief overseeing the investigation

318
00:17:15,259 --> 00:17:18,159
I decided that this would
be a full investigation

319
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:21,604
because of the closeness

320
00:17:21,706 --> 00:17:23,706
this aircraft came to disaster

321
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:27,630
we then dispatched
small team of investigators

322
00:17:27,948 --> 00:17:32,461
to the operators based to interview
the crew and to examine the aircraft

323
00:17:35,258 --> 00:17:40,483
very quickly the flight data and cockpit
voice recorder are recovered from Saab 2000

324
00:17:41,423 --> 00:17:42,423
very well

325
00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:50,559
the normal price has for investigation
is the investigators take the recorder

326
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:52,901
the cockpit voice recorder
and the flight data recorder

327
00:17:52,983 --> 00:17:55,319
bring them back to the
laboratories and recover the data

328
00:17:56,059 --> 00:17:58,059
looks to be in pretty good shape

329
00:17:58,341 --> 00:17:59,381
unusually sir
yeah

330
00:18:00,863 --> 00:18:04,980
investigators need to confirm the
crew's report of a lightening strike

331
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:08,623
as well as the flight attendant's
account of seeing an orb of light

332
00:18:08,623 --> 00:18:10,303
passed through the cabin

333
00:18:13,982 --> 00:18:17,382
ball lightening is rare and
little understood phenomena

334
00:18:17,382 --> 00:18:20,420
known to precede lightening
strikes inside airplanes

335
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,280
all right

336
00:18:28,142 --> 00:18:30,742
well there is no
damage on the wing tip

337
00:18:32,907 --> 00:18:35,807
the lightening can strike
almost anywhere on the aircraft

338
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,102
but it tends to strike on the
leading edge of the wings

339
00:18:38,503 --> 00:18:40,803
on the radome at
the front of the aircraft

340
00:18:45,819 --> 00:18:46,819
marks on the radio

341
00:18:48,942 --> 00:18:53,025
investigators see signs of a lightening
strike on the nose of the aircraft

342
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,980
looks like some surface
damaged as well

343
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
yeah
yeah

344
00:18:57,983 --> 00:19:01,623
the point of strike
will often leave scar

345
00:19:01,664 --> 00:19:03,264
localize burning

346
00:19:03,667 --> 00:19:05,667
sometimes a small hole

347
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,980
right let's see where
it exited the aircraft

348
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:17,221
elevators look fine

349
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,420
hang on

350
00:19:25,903 --> 00:19:27,503
have a look at that exhaust cone

351
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,300
oh yeah

352
00:19:32,542 --> 00:19:34,542
that's where the
lightening exited

353
00:19:35,099 --> 00:19:37,281
it could have possibly
completely melted

354
00:19:37,381 --> 00:19:40,363
there is little bit of burning damage
both to the front of the aircraft

355
00:19:40,423 --> 00:19:44,498
and the exit point of the lightening strike
which was at the very tale of the aircraft

356
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,520
where the auxiliary power
unit exhaust was placed

357
00:19:48,684 --> 00:19:49,684
oh
crap

358
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:54,006
the team now knows how
the lightening struck the plane

359
00:19:57,219 --> 00:19:58,719
controls feel very heavy

360
00:20:00,022 --> 00:20:02,022
so one of the first thing
you gotta have a look at

361
00:20:02,023 --> 00:20:04,023
what was the effect
of the lightening strike?

362
00:20:04,044 --> 00:20:06,244
where the systems damaged?
were there malfunctions?

363
00:20:10,779 --> 00:20:12,059
okay
you're ready

364
00:20:12,501 --> 00:20:15,101
the AAIB tests the
plane's flight control

365
00:20:15,342 --> 00:20:17,042
to see if they're working

366
00:20:17,343 --> 00:20:18,843
okay
check the rudder

367
00:20:25,464 --> 00:20:26,464
looks good

368
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,700
how about the elevators?

369
00:20:34,325 --> 00:20:36,225
yeah, elevators are working too

370
00:20:36,306 --> 00:20:37,306
everything checks out

371
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,620
investigators are perplexed

372
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,300
if the plane was
functioning properly

373
00:20:42,862 --> 00:20:46,678
why did it become so difficult to
control after the lightening strike?

374
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,200
there were no abnormalities

375
00:20:50,418 --> 00:20:53,901
no system defects that we can find
either structurally or within the avionics

376
00:20:54,381 --> 00:20:55,381
beyond that

377
00:20:55,502 --> 00:20:59,022
it looked like a completely
normal serviceable aircraft

378
00:21:01,938 --> 00:21:05,861
AAIB investigators interviewed
the pilots of flight 6078

379
00:21:08,626 --> 00:21:10,826
we're fortunate enough
as in these circumstances

380
00:21:10,865 --> 00:21:12,298
to have a surviving flight crew

381
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:15,059
then their recollections are really
important for us to understand

382
00:21:15,142 --> 00:21:18,442
exactly how the event
progressed from their perspective

383
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,301
so what happened after the
lightening struck the plane?

384
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:25,384
after the lightening struck
the auto pilot disconnected

385
00:21:33,622 --> 00:21:34,742
I have control

386
00:21:35,904 --> 00:21:38,604
the crew of the aircraft
become aware

387
00:21:38,986 --> 00:21:40,986
early shortly after
the lightening strike

388
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:45,502
the aircraft wasn't responding as they
expected to their flight control inputs

389
00:21:45,939 --> 00:21:46,939
and then what happened?

390
00:21:49,062 --> 00:21:50,062
we had control issues

391
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,060
plane wouldn't climb

392
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:54,482
we tried everything and
the plane wasn't responding

393
00:21:57,663 --> 00:21:58,663
the pilot flying

394
00:21:59,064 --> 00:22:02,936
was finding that he was having to
put an increasing strong backward effort

395
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:05,689
on the control column
to rise the nose of aircraft

396
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,959
I can't get the plane to climb
how's your side?

397
00:22:09,982 --> 00:22:10,982
it's really heavy

398
00:22:12,543 --> 00:22:14,543
trims not doing anything either

399
00:22:14,544 --> 00:22:17,120
the aircraft wasn't responding
the way that he expected

400
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,780
and then

401
00:22:20,343 --> 00:22:22,343
and then we enter
the steep nose dive

402
00:22:22,821 --> 00:22:24,821
and the control issues continued

403
00:22:32,387 --> 00:22:33,587
nothing working

404
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,100
come on

405
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,940
pull up

406
00:22:38,343 --> 00:22:39,343
speed
speed

407
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,140
and wasn't until after
we increased power

408
00:22:49,181 --> 00:22:51,241
we were able to get
the aircraft under control

409
00:22:53,385 --> 00:22:54,385
oh really

410
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:58,825
why did the crew believe that they had
control restrictions and control problems?

411
00:22:58,841 --> 00:23:02,182
when in fact testing of the aircraft
show that there were no faults

412
00:23:08,661 --> 00:23:10,361
lest have a listen
shall we?

413
00:23:10,623 --> 00:23:14,326
puzzled by the crew's account of
the incident on board flight 6078

414
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:18,579
investigators turn to the cockpit
voice recorder for answers

415
00:23:19,101 --> 00:23:21,101
it will answers many questions

416
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:23,900
as to why things were
happening the way they were

417
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,800
and how the crew were working
together and interacting together

418
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,180
but something's not right

419
00:23:35,462 --> 00:23:36,462
Aberdeen

420
00:23:37,982 --> 00:23:39,682
this is for when they
land back at Aberdeen

421
00:23:39,765 --> 00:23:40,765
stop it and

422
00:23:41,179 --> 00:23:43,179
go back to the top
play it again please

423
00:23:51,582 --> 00:23:52,582
that's what there is

424
00:23:54,103 --> 00:23:56,303
well that's not gonna
help us very much now, is it?

425
00:23:58,027 --> 00:24:01,640
the CVR has recorded over
the critical moments of the flight

426
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,600
it's a major setback
for the investigation

427
00:24:05,743 --> 00:24:08,743
we discover that the cockpit voice
recorder which only last for 30 minutes

428
00:24:09,138 --> 00:24:11,538
has been overwritten
by subsequent events

429
00:24:12,142 --> 00:24:14,942
so there was no record
of crew conversation

430
00:24:15,264 --> 00:24:16,998
and how they
interacted with each other

431
00:24:19,782 --> 00:24:21,902
and so you have to look
elsewhere for information

432
00:24:27,182 --> 00:24:28,182
right

433
00:24:28,241 --> 00:24:29,941
this is what we know so far

434
00:24:29,943 --> 00:24:32,143
the lightening struck
the auto pilot disconnected

435
00:24:32,499 --> 00:24:33,999
they had control problems

436
00:24:34,219 --> 00:24:35,219
then

437
00:24:35,661 --> 00:24:37,161
the plane did a nose dive

438
00:24:37,623 --> 00:24:39,123
let's review the data

439
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:44,923
will the data recorder provide the
answers they need to solve this case?

440
00:24:46,579 --> 00:24:50,479
flight data recorders
often add a level of detail

441
00:24:50,501 --> 00:24:53,040
that simply can't be gain
from the witnesses themselves

442
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,700
and crucially

443
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:57,902
quite often the information that's
gathered from a recording device

444
00:24:58,103 --> 00:25:01,103
offers a slightly different
perspective to what we might get from

445
00:25:01,139 --> 00:25:02,819
personal recollections

446
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:04,702
so

447
00:25:05,502 --> 00:25:08,002
this is where the
lightening struck at 2000 feet

448
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,900
right and then the next
2.5 minutes there is a slow

449
00:25:11,061 --> 00:25:12,561
uneven climb to 4000 feet

450
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:18,423
and then they are in a very steep nose
dive 20 seconds towards the north sea

451
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,460
that's 500 feet per minute

452
00:25:25,578 --> 00:25:30,260
investigators are struck by how
close the flight came to total disaster

453
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,360
it was 7 seconds

454
00:25:32,821 --> 00:25:34,521
from plunging into the sea

455
00:25:34,823 --> 00:25:37,204
before they finally manage
to pull out at 1100 feet

456
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,422
the aircraft had a very
high rate of descent

457
00:25:40,462 --> 00:25:42,462
in a moments before
reached that height

458
00:25:42,462 --> 00:25:45,580
and so we were really very
close to very serious accident

459
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:50,322
what were the pilots doing
to recover from the dive?

460
00:25:52,299 --> 00:25:54,099
look at the control column data

461
00:25:55,142 --> 00:25:57,142
right after the lightening strike

462
00:25:57,383 --> 00:26:00,901
crew pull back on the control
column to pitched the nose up

463
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,540
I have control

464
00:26:09,223 --> 00:26:10,723
controls feel really heavy

465
00:26:12,019 --> 00:26:13,019
look at the line, I mean

466
00:26:13,381 --> 00:26:16,462
they're having a very difficult
time getting that plane to climb

467
00:26:17,299 --> 00:26:21,160
we know from the data that the
aircraft climb to around about 4000 feet

468
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:25,879
the pilot was finding that he was
having to put an increasing strong

469
00:26:25,983 --> 00:26:29,624
backward effort on the control
column to raise the nose of the aircraft

470
00:26:30,746 --> 00:26:33,639
and the aircraft wasn't
responding the way the he expected

471
00:26:34,702 --> 00:26:38,940
the FDR data confirms the pilots
were tackling a control problem

472
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:39,940
but why?

473
00:26:40,858 --> 00:26:42,960
the captain said they
were also applying pitch trim

474
00:26:46,783 --> 00:26:49,783
pitched trim moves the
tail elevator up and down

475
00:26:49,785 --> 00:26:52,585
to maintain the
pitch of the aircraft

476
00:26:54,582 --> 00:26:57,002
can we take a look at
the pitch trim data please?

477
00:26:57,143 --> 00:26:58,143
right

478
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,300
investigators make
a puzzling discovery

479
00:27:04,302 --> 00:27:05,302
look at that

480
00:27:05,706 --> 00:27:09,106
the elevators trying to get the
nose to pitch down instead of up

481
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,060
after the lightening strike

482
00:27:13,261 --> 00:27:16,001
some unknown force was
fighting the pilot's inputs

483
00:27:16,064 --> 00:27:18,666
to both the control
column and the pitch trim

484
00:27:19,132 --> 00:27:21,132
it's very difficult
to imagine what

485
00:27:21,501 --> 00:27:23,641
let's say 80 pound
force feels like

486
00:27:25,983 --> 00:27:29,426
normal control pressures
are much much lower than that

487
00:27:29,466 --> 00:27:31,066
sort of 10 to 20 pounds

488
00:27:31,739 --> 00:27:35,922
so an 80 pound pull is really extraordinary
and very difficult to maintain

489
00:27:39,064 --> 00:27:40,504
something is wrong

490
00:27:40,785 --> 00:27:42,485
I can't get the plane to climb

491
00:27:42,508 --> 00:27:43,508
how's your side?

492
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:45,229
it's really heavy

493
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,580
trim is not doing
anything either

494
00:27:49,341 --> 00:27:52,743
we found that although the pilots
were applying a significant nose up pitch

495
00:27:53,864 --> 00:27:56,599
control input while pulling
the stick back towards them

496
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:58,941
the aircraft was
actually trims nose down

497
00:28:00,903 --> 00:28:03,984
whatever was trimming
the pitch control system

498
00:28:04,105 --> 00:28:06,706
was effectively overcoming
the effort of the pilots

499
00:28:11,421 --> 00:28:12,421
the crew said

500
00:28:12,821 --> 00:28:14,501
the lightening struck

501
00:28:15,062 --> 00:28:17,062
the autopilot disconnected

502
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,620
then they had control problems

503
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:22,882
can we take a look at
the auto pilot database?

504
00:28:24,945 --> 00:28:26,945
finally the team
zeros in on the answer

505
00:28:30,862 --> 00:28:33,862
the auto pilot was on
almost the entire time

506
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:39,022
the pilots themselves were very clear in
their recollection that it had disengaged

507
00:28:42,144 --> 00:28:45,628
while the evidence we had indicated that
the autopilot had in fact remained engaged

508
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,940
it's no wonder the pilot
had control problems

509
00:28:49,221 --> 00:28:51,703
the auto pilot was to set to
keep the plane 2000 feet

510
00:28:51,743 --> 00:28:54,743
right and whenever the pilot's
trying to get the plane to climb

511
00:28:54,805 --> 00:28:57,306
the autopilot would engaged
and bring the plane back down

512
00:28:57,619 --> 00:28:59,219
back to a signed up altitude

513
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:03,579
investigators discover that
after the lightening strike

514
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:06,963
the pilots were in a
tug of war with the plane

515
00:29:07,384 --> 00:29:09,884
I can't get the plane to climb
how's your side?

516
00:29:10,786 --> 00:29:11,786
it's really heavy

517
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:17,563
so then we have to
look at why did the crew

518
00:29:17,582 --> 00:29:20,182
misunderstand the
status of the aircraft

519
00:29:24,901 --> 00:29:28,985
the AAIB contacts the
captain of flight 6078

520
00:29:29,658 --> 00:29:33,258
to better understand why he
taught the auto pilot disconnected

521
00:29:33,341 --> 00:29:34,341
when in fact it hadn't

522
00:29:35,863 --> 00:29:36,903
the Saab 340

523
00:29:38,379 --> 00:29:39,379
okay
thanks

524
00:29:43,458 --> 00:29:46,520
he said he assumed the lightening
would disable the auto pilot

525
00:29:47,942 --> 00:29:52,100
the team learns the pilot trained for
lightening strikes on another airplane

526
00:29:52,381 --> 00:29:53,381
the Saab 340

527
00:29:54,342 --> 00:29:57,342
the change from Saab
340 to the Saab 2000

528
00:29:57,708 --> 00:30:00,800
you can say it's like changing
from a motor bike to a bus

529
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,940
all systems are different

530
00:30:03,543 --> 00:30:05,043
performance is different

531
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:08,905
you're flying a totally
different airplane

532
00:30:11,422 --> 00:30:13,422
during the training of Saab 340

533
00:30:14,222 --> 00:30:19,245
the commander had experienced a
simulated lightening strike to the aircraft

534
00:30:20,179 --> 00:30:22,179
which cause both
generators to fail

535
00:30:23,302 --> 00:30:24,302
and in doing so

536
00:30:24,703 --> 00:30:26,703
cause the auto the
pilot to disconnect

537
00:30:27,785 --> 00:30:28,785
I have control

538
00:30:30,298 --> 00:30:32,560
so when the lightening
strike happened for real

539
00:30:33,662 --> 00:30:35,022
his first thought were

540
00:30:35,342 --> 00:30:36,842
the auto pilot has failed

541
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:39,185
the controls feel very heavy

542
00:30:40,145 --> 00:30:41,845
I must control
the aircraft myself

543
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:45,979
and in fact the lightening
strike had had minimal effect

544
00:30:46,021 --> 00:30:47,021
on the aircraft

545
00:30:48,023 --> 00:30:51,075
would you pull up the control
data column again please?

546
00:30:51,139 --> 00:30:53,639
if the lightning didn't
disconnect the autopilot

547
00:30:53,981 --> 00:30:58,381
investigators wonder why it remained
engaged for more than 2 minutes

548
00:30:58,499 --> 00:31:01,020
as the pilots struggled
with the controls

549
00:31:01,061 --> 00:31:05,361
wouldn't the force applied to the
control column and the pitched trim

550
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,500
have overwritten the autopilot?

551
00:31:12,265 --> 00:31:13,565
in most aircraft

552
00:31:13,755 --> 00:31:15,655
if the pilot intervenes
on the controls

553
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:19,222
and tries to apply a
forced against the autopilot

554
00:31:19,382 --> 00:31:21,082
the autopilot
decided to disengage

555
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:25,758
one way of thinking about this is to
imagine you're driving down a highway

556
00:31:25,779 --> 00:31:27,379
in a car on cruise control

557
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:30,281
and you're getting close
to a car in front of you

558
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:31,622
so you press the break

559
00:31:32,064 --> 00:31:34,644
and what you expect to
happen is for the car to slow down

560
00:31:34,981 --> 00:31:38,382
you don't expect the cruise
control to oppose the break

561
00:31:38,582 --> 00:31:41,599
and add more power to
maintain 65 miles an hour

562
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,501
but that's essentially what
was happening in this case

563
00:31:46,698 --> 00:31:50,421
the autopilot was attempting
to keep the plane at 2000 feet

564
00:31:50,941 --> 00:31:53,941
despite all attempts
by crew to climb

565
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:54,978
says here

566
00:31:55,419 --> 00:31:59,662
applying an override force to the column
will not cause the auto pilot to disengaged

567
00:32:00,784 --> 00:32:02,284
and the Saab 2000

568
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:05,240
the autopilot would not
disconnect when you exert force

569
00:32:06,141 --> 00:32:07,141
on the control columns

570
00:32:08,424 --> 00:32:09,424
there is more

571
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,820
pressing the main
pitch trim switches

572
00:32:12,341 --> 00:32:15,944
also has no effect to cause
the autopilot disengage

573
00:32:17,704 --> 00:32:19,604
the team is
surprised to discover

574
00:32:19,701 --> 00:32:23,201
there is no force override for
the autopilot in the Saab 2000

575
00:32:25,904 --> 00:32:26,904
something's wrong

576
00:32:27,905 --> 00:32:29,605
I can't get the plane to climb

577
00:32:29,626 --> 00:32:32,226
one thing the pilot would
have done as he pulled back

578
00:32:32,401 --> 00:32:34,141
have feeling the force
on the control column

579
00:32:34,222 --> 00:32:37,222
he would have used the switches
on the control column, to apply

580
00:32:37,543 --> 00:32:39,243
trim inappropriate way

581
00:32:39,786 --> 00:32:40,986
how's your side

582
00:32:41,786 --> 00:32:42,786
it's really heavy

583
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:48,299
trims not doing anything either

584
00:32:48,581 --> 00:32:52,123
but when the autopilot
engaged in this model of aircraft

585
00:32:52,264 --> 00:32:53,964
the trim switches are inhibited

586
00:32:53,985 --> 00:32:56,786
so no matter how much they
selected those trim switches

587
00:32:56,827 --> 00:32:58,827
they were having
absolutely no effects

588
00:33:02,984 --> 00:33:05,944
investigators soon
discover that the Saab 2000

589
00:33:06,362 --> 00:33:07,362
is unique

590
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,400
look at that

591
00:33:10,741 --> 00:33:12,639
it's one of the few
planes in existence

592
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,660
that doesn't have
an autopilot override

593
00:33:15,461 --> 00:33:18,260
every plane has an
autopilot override function

594
00:33:18,819 --> 00:33:20,919
except for the Saab 2000

595
00:33:24,698 --> 00:33:27,740
it just had a different design to
all the other aircraft we're aware of

596
00:33:28,661 --> 00:33:33,725
and really to discover that the autopilot
had greater authority than the human pilots

597
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,540
was a bit of revelation for us

598
00:33:39,339 --> 00:33:42,339
it's still doesn't explain
why the crew didn't know

599
00:33:42,421 --> 00:33:45,488
the autopilot was on
almost the entire time

600
00:33:46,664 --> 00:33:49,164
wouldn't be some sort of
indicator on the cockpit?

601
00:33:49,266 --> 00:33:51,266
yeah, I show you
look over here

602
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:57,142
when the autopilot is
connected that will be a green AP

603
00:33:59,102 --> 00:34:02,184
what does a control panel look
like when the autopilot goes off?

604
00:34:02,705 --> 00:34:03,705
like this

605
00:34:08,903 --> 00:34:12,362
when that autopilot is not
connected it will be a white AP

606
00:34:12,504 --> 00:34:14,184
but the letters AP remain

607
00:34:14,788 --> 00:34:15,788
that's it

608
00:34:15,843 --> 00:34:18,363
that's it just goes
from green to white

609
00:34:18,901 --> 00:34:22,859
one could argue weather
that visual clue is enough

610
00:34:24,261 --> 00:34:27,321
to warn the crew
status of the autopilot

611
00:34:28,424 --> 00:34:29,544
I have control

612
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:36,061
it's not as if the AP disappears when it's
not engaged and appears when it is engaged

613
00:34:36,622 --> 00:34:38,622
oh no
come on

614
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:40,263
we're dropping

615
00:34:40,584 --> 00:34:43,640
all we have here is color
change between green and white

616
00:34:43,979 --> 00:34:45,779
and sometimes is very
difficult to perceived

617
00:34:46,822 --> 00:34:49,722
when you're in a
high stress situation

618
00:34:53,826 --> 00:34:55,180
investigators believed

619
00:34:55,187 --> 00:34:59,863
that the auto pilot visual indication might
have been too small for the pilots to see

620
00:35:00,021 --> 00:35:02,021
as they struggle to
control their plane

621
00:35:08,262 --> 00:35:10,223
sure there would have
been alarm warnings

622
00:35:12,705 --> 00:35:13,705
yes right here

623
00:35:13,859 --> 00:35:17,140
it says the plane's computer
would have sound the caution chime

624
00:35:18,061 --> 00:35:22,019
even if the pilots missed the
visual indications for the autopilot

625
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:26,041
caution chimes would have alerted
them when they adjust the pitched trim

626
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,841
the captain didn't say anything
about hearing any chimes

627
00:35:30,101 --> 00:35:32,101
right so
what's going on them?

628
00:35:40,541 --> 00:35:43,641
they're trimming against the
auto pilot for more than 10 seconds

629
00:35:43,664 --> 00:35:48,842
a chime will announce to say that
there is a pitch miss trim situation

630
00:35:51,184 --> 00:35:54,540
we see from the data it's highly
likely that the alert would have occurred

631
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,920
but the crew don't
recall having heard it

632
00:35:57,941 --> 00:35:59,221
nothings working

633
00:35:59,502 --> 00:36:00,502
come on

634
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:03,184
so why did the
pilots of flight 6078

635
00:36:03,345 --> 00:36:07,569
ignore all warnings telling them
that the autopilot was in control?

636
00:36:10,109 --> 00:36:13,409
AAIB investigators have learned
that after the lightening strike

637
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:18,362
the crew of Logan air flight 6078
didn't recall hearing audible warnings

638
00:36:18,546 --> 00:36:22,926
that the auto pilot was engaged
and set to maintain 2000 feet

639
00:36:24,459 --> 00:36:26,759
the lightening struck the plane

640
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,980
and for 2.5 minutes

641
00:36:29,504 --> 00:36:32,484
the crew struggle with the
controls to get the plane to climb

642
00:36:32,583 --> 00:36:34,783
right, they were
so distracted by that

643
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,820
failed to see what
was really going on

644
00:36:38,703 --> 00:36:42,425
could stress have affected
that perception of the situation?

645
00:36:47,669 --> 00:36:50,359
you have to bear in mind
of course this was at night

646
00:36:50,781 --> 00:36:52,281
in turbulent poor weather

647
00:36:52,782 --> 00:36:53,782
heavy rain

648
00:36:55,979 --> 00:36:58,540
and the lightening strike would
have been really quite bright

649
00:36:59,381 --> 00:37:01,442
and the noise would
have been alarming

650
00:37:05,019 --> 00:37:06,819
so it's sort of understandable

651
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,980
their performance was degraded

652
00:37:09,261 --> 00:37:11,261
because of the stress situation

653
00:37:11,543 --> 00:37:12,543
I have control

654
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:17,102
the couple of things
happen when we get stressed

655
00:37:17,181 --> 00:37:19,184
we tend to focus on
fewer and fewer things

656
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:23,464
and we tend to not
notice the other things

657
00:37:23,706 --> 00:37:26,906
and that can be
either visual cues or

658
00:37:27,099 --> 00:37:28,099
auditory cues

659
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,240
so we get what's called
cognitive tunneling

660
00:37:30,262 --> 00:37:32,623
and one aspect to that is
an essential deafness so

661
00:37:33,563 --> 00:37:34,963
an alert might occur

662
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:35,986
but we might not hear it

663
00:37:38,939 --> 00:37:40,939
it's very difficult
for a crew to

664
00:37:41,741 --> 00:37:44,583
break the vicious circle of
cognitive tunneling where

665
00:37:45,383 --> 00:37:49,507
a concentrating on one event
and not looking on the bigger picture

666
00:37:51,029 --> 00:37:53,029
controls feel really heavy

667
00:37:53,309 --> 00:37:56,340
but if the pilots were suffering
from cognitive tunneling

668
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:00,782
how would they able to
regain control of the plane?

669
00:38:04,665 --> 00:38:05,665
okay
look at this

670
00:38:06,387 --> 00:38:10,200
the AAIB makes one
last horrifying discovery

671
00:38:11,141 --> 00:38:14,539
the only reason the
autopilot ever disengaged

672
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:19,942
was because of a random glitch
in the plane's computer system

673
00:38:21,864 --> 00:38:23,864
reason for disconnection
was that there was a

674
00:38:24,099 --> 00:38:26,159
a momentary lost
of data of computer

675
00:38:26,661 --> 00:38:29,883
and we know that's one of the conditions
that caused the autopilot disconnect

676
00:38:30,063 --> 00:38:32,063
and that's what cause it
to disconnect in this case

677
00:38:33,659 --> 00:38:38,659
if the autopilot wouldn't
disconnected more than 7 seconds later

678
00:38:38,703 --> 00:38:42,319
the plane would have gone
into the ocean in a night

679
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,260
at over 300 knots

680
00:38:45,743 --> 00:38:47,743
this was a fatal
action by pure lock

681
00:38:50,226 --> 00:38:52,726
investigators believed
they finally understand

682
00:38:52,748 --> 00:38:56,942
what caused the terrifying incident
on board Logan air flight 6078

683
00:39:03,063 --> 00:39:06,563
while circling away from a
bad storm at Sumburgh airport

684
00:39:06,705 --> 00:39:07,705
roger that

685
00:39:08,139 --> 00:39:09,939
we'll wait till the storm ...

686
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:13,501
the crew startled and
disoriented by a lightening strike

687
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:19,666
in a moment of high stress the captain
believes the autopilot has disengaged

688
00:39:22,145 --> 00:39:23,265
I have control

689
00:39:23,871 --> 00:39:24,871
when it hasn't

690
00:39:27,822 --> 00:39:30,701
the autopilot remain engaged and
they didn't realize that was the case

691
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:34,702
so effectively from that point until it
disengaged they were fighting the autopilot

692
00:39:34,904 --> 00:39:36,504
they wanted to climb
it wanted to descend

693
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:41,021
because of the way the flight control
configures the autopilot was going to win

694
00:39:42,182 --> 00:39:44,682
engaged in a tug of
war with the aircraft

695
00:39:45,024 --> 00:39:47,024
cognitive tunneling takes over

696
00:39:48,146 --> 00:39:49,586
something is wrong

697
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,100
I can't get the plane to climb
how's your side?

698
00:39:53,221 --> 00:39:56,221
the highly stressed pilots don't
register the audible warnings

699
00:39:56,263 --> 00:39:58,785
telling them that the
autopilot is still engaged

700
00:39:59,665 --> 00:40:00,665
it's really heavy

701
00:40:01,948 --> 00:40:03,948
trim is not doing
anything either

702
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:10,142
the final blow is one of a kind
autopilot system without a force override

703
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:14,884
I have every sympathy for crews being
startled with something unusual happens

704
00:40:14,906 --> 00:40:18,548
whether there is an explosive engine
failure or lightening strike in this case

705
00:40:18,868 --> 00:40:20,868
but the training must kick in

706
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,820
and the crew must revert to

707
00:40:23,943 --> 00:40:27,002
in effect as I said sit on
your hands for a few moments

708
00:40:27,345 --> 00:40:28,785
make an assessment
of what's happened

709
00:40:29,619 --> 00:40:32,981
what's gone wrong
what's working, what's not working

710
00:40:33,422 --> 00:40:35,422
and then deal with
the situation from there

711
00:40:36,384 --> 00:40:38,584
oh no
come on

712
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:40,307
we're dropping

713
00:40:44,258 --> 00:40:48,062
if it wasn't for a split second
fluke error in the computer system

714
00:40:48,782 --> 00:40:50,982
and the relentless
efforts of the crew

715
00:40:51,023 --> 00:40:52,023
speed
speed

716
00:40:53,865 --> 00:40:58,669
flight 6078 would have slammed
into the north sea at 380 miles per hour

717
00:41:05,381 --> 00:41:08,063
I would say it was a nervous
flight for a couple of years

718
00:41:08,184 --> 00:41:10,184
so I've just kind of gone
through the emotions of

719
00:41:10,244 --> 00:41:12,644
sort of building myself up to noon
it's gonna be fine

720
00:41:18,021 --> 00:41:22,621
the final report recommend several
safety changes to the autopilot system

721
00:41:22,983 --> 00:41:27,183
within my recommendations looking at
how aircraft could be certified in future

722
00:41:27,501 --> 00:41:33,901
so make sure that no future design could
be certified where neither operation of the

723
00:41:34,179 --> 00:41:37,720
control column nor operation
of the pitch control switches

724
00:41:37,861 --> 00:41:40,459
would result in
disconnection of the autopilot

725
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:44,620
for investigators the
lessons of Logan air 6078

726
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,580
go beyond this one near tragedy

727
00:41:52,499 --> 00:41:55,499
you can only go so far in
educating human operators

728
00:41:55,622 --> 00:41:56,622
in how system works

729
00:41:57,343 --> 00:42:00,585
ultimately we have to recognize
that they will behave instinctively

730
00:42:00,987 --> 00:42:02,887
particularly when under stress

731
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:05,980
that's the real challenge for
the future of automated systems
