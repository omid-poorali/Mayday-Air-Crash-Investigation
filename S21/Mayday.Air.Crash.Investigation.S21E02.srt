1
00:00:01,384 --> 00:00:04,779
a business jet shuttling
passengers to Akron, Ohio

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:06,339
no no no

3
00:00:08,301 --> 00:00:12,304
slams into a residential neighborhood
less than 2 miles from the runway

4
00:00:12,504 --> 00:00:14,584
we have a plane into a house
heavy fire

5
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,040
there are no survivors

6
00:00:21,218 --> 00:00:24,902
investigators searched the
wreckage but find few clues

7
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:28,822
the aircraft was burned down
to almost nothing on the hill

8
00:00:31,901 --> 00:00:34,601
but a close examination
of radar data

9
00:00:34,699 --> 00:00:35,699
provides a lead

10
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,500
they're clear to descend
and then they wait

11
00:00:39,779 --> 00:00:40,779
full two minutes

12
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,780
why?

13
00:00:43,622 --> 00:00:46,844
we really wondered what is the
situation in the cockpit at that time?

14
00:00:47,304 --> 00:00:48,939
hey you guys you know
where you are going

15
00:00:48,939 --> 00:00:50,239
it's going to be some weather so

16
00:00:50,261 --> 00:00:52,260
I'd like to have your
update with the flight

17
00:00:52,542 --> 00:00:54,042
well did you hear that?

18
00:01:19,987 --> 00:01:21,687
execuflight Flight 1526

19
00:01:22,779 --> 00:01:24,779
is climbing towards
cruising altitude

20
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,340
over the us Midwest

21
00:01:31,218 --> 00:01:33,718
let's keep climbing
with 150 feet per minute

22
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,300
roger

23
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:45,542
on board are 7 executives from a
Florida base property management company

24
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,620
sorry

25
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:52,901
they've charted the
luxury jet from execuflight

26
00:01:53,023 --> 00:01:55,023
a private carrier based
in Fort Lauderdale

27
00:01:58,107 --> 00:02:01,107
Donnie Shackleford is a former
captain who flew with execuflight

28
00:02:02,901 --> 00:02:07,401
execuflight caters to the people of
south Florida for business purposes

29
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:12,002
also to entrepreneurs,
athletes and even entertainers

30
00:02:14,424 --> 00:02:15,424
17,000 feet

31
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,420
roger
17,000 feet

32
00:02:20,221 --> 00:02:21,221
leveling off

33
00:02:26,418 --> 00:02:30,381
execuflight 1526 is flying
a short 35 minute flight

34
00:02:31,182 --> 00:02:33,182
north east from
Dayton to Akron Ohio

35
00:02:36,821 --> 00:02:41,628
first officer Renato Marchese is the
pilot flying the twin engine Hawker 700

36
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:46,060
he's logged more than 4000
hours flying various private jets

37
00:02:48,862 --> 00:02:51,862
Captain Oscar Chávez
is originally from Colombia

38
00:02:52,826 --> 00:02:56,980
and he's logged over 6000 hours
flying private jets and cargo planes

39
00:02:59,302 --> 00:03:01,783
the captain had flown
with me as the first officer

40
00:03:02,905 --> 00:03:04,622
he was to get pilot

41
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:07,741
Oscar and Renato both same to enjoy flight
a great deal

42
00:03:08,543 --> 00:03:10,543
it was a passion
for both of them

43
00:03:12,499 --> 00:03:13,499
hey guys

44
00:03:13,781 --> 00:03:15,781
we've just reached
our cruising altitude

45
00:03:15,781 --> 00:03:16,781
you know the drill

46
00:03:17,222 --> 00:03:18,822
we'll be landing at
Akron in half an hour

47
00:03:21,465 --> 00:03:22,465
anyone else want a drink?

48
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,861
the Hawker 700 passenger
experience was more than comfortable

49
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:29,621
they had a good galley

50
00:03:31,385 --> 00:03:32,385
had plenty of headroom

51
00:03:33,385 --> 00:03:34,385
the interior was updated

52
00:03:35,418 --> 00:03:37,418
it was a very nice airplane

53
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,420
cheers

54
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,181
zipline 1526
decent to 13000

55
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,520
zipline is
execuflight's call sign

56
00:03:52,744 --> 00:03:54,244
descending to 13000 feet

57
00:03:55,299 --> 00:03:56,899
thank you zipline 1526

58
00:03:59,262 --> 00:04:00,262
let me check the weather

59
00:04:01,543 --> 00:04:03,543
automated weather observation

60
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:06,819
wind 290 at 07

61
00:04:08,062 --> 00:04:09,962
overcast 1800

62
00:04:10,864 --> 00:04:11,864
temperature 0.9 Celsius

63
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,260
right

64
00:04:15,821 --> 00:04:16,821
we have overcast weather

65
00:04:19,222 --> 00:04:22,244
the crew prepares for
possible bad weather in Akron

66
00:04:24,261 --> 00:04:25,261
okay
let's see

67
00:04:26,501 --> 00:04:27,501
Akron
right

68
00:04:29,864 --> 00:04:30,864
heading
24 at 9

69
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,160
flight 1526 continues its decent

70
00:04:41,946 --> 00:04:44,640
Akron airport is less
than 20 minutes away

71
00:04:47,303 --> 00:04:49,342
I'm gonna go check
to see where we're at

72
00:04:53,788 --> 00:04:55,818
hey you guys know
where you're going?

73
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,500
you bet
look

74
00:04:58,781 --> 00:05:00,848
it says we're here on the chart

75
00:05:02,099 --> 00:05:04,160
I'd love to have you
updated all the time

76
00:05:04,341 --> 00:05:05,908
but there's going to
be some weather

77
00:05:06,043 --> 00:05:07,043
so we can't be distracted

78
00:05:09,987 --> 00:05:12,780
it's not like the airlines
where you have a close door

79
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,062
there is an open door I mean they
can .. to the cockpit and ask questions

80
00:05:22,027 --> 00:05:25,080
as flight 1526
descends to 9000 feet

81
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,541
Akron visibility 1.5 mist

82
00:05:30,183 --> 00:05:33,583
sky condition
overcast 600 broken

83
00:05:35,187 --> 00:05:38,259
the crew learns the weather
in Akron is getting worst

84
00:05:38,861 --> 00:05:41,161
temperature 11 Celsius

85
00:05:43,586 --> 00:05:46,000
they need to know if it's
still possible to land there

86
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,640
1.5 mile of visibility

87
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,944
what visibility does
this approach want?

88
00:05:53,024 --> 00:05:54,024
1.25 miles

89
00:05:55,547 --> 00:05:57,547
all right
so we have visibility

90
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,280
6 minutes from Akron, the
crew has a new distraction

91
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:05,541
a flight instructor

92
00:06:05,982 --> 00:06:09,106
he's teaching a student pilot
how to land in bad weather

93
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:12,583
on the same runway
assigned to flight 1526

94
00:06:17,098 --> 00:06:18,098
zipline 1526

95
00:06:19,105 --> 00:06:23,482
we do have another aircraft that's inbound
to the airport that is slower than you

96
00:06:23,623 --> 00:06:25,223
flight heading 360

97
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:28,830
reduce speed to 170
descend and maintain 3000

98
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:34,384
the crew is asked
to alter their course

99
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:38,901
delay the descent and
maintain their altitude at 3000 feet

100
00:06:41,824 --> 00:06:44,924
speed is 170
and 360

101
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,060
zipline 1526

102
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,620
zipline 1526

103
00:06:56,061 --> 00:06:59,061
the piper is on the ground
you are clear for localize 25 approach

104
00:07:00,268 --> 00:07:03,268
clear for localize at 25, thank you
zipline 1526

105
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:17,380
the piper radios flight 1526
with the weather update

106
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:21,238
hey guys
we just land on the localizer

107
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,527
and broke out
right at the minimum

108
00:07:23,822 --> 00:07:24,822
appreciated

109
00:07:27,745 --> 00:07:30,245
they said we broke
out right at minimum

110
00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:34,422
which means you're at the minimum
visibility necessary for the approach

111
00:07:36,744 --> 00:07:39,944
flight 1526 is now 4
miles from the runway

112
00:07:40,387 --> 00:07:42,387
as it starts its final approach

113
00:07:49,024 --> 00:07:51,024
everything is all set
standby

114
00:07:56,862 --> 00:07:58,862
2.5 miles from the airport

115
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,545
the pilots are still
searching for the runway

116
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:10,704
finally the plane breaks
through the clouds

117
00:08:12,347 --> 00:08:13,347
ground

118
00:08:16,423 --> 00:08:17,423
keep going

119
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,100
okay okay
level up that

120
00:08:27,485 --> 00:08:28,485
I got it

121
00:08:29,705 --> 00:08:30,705
pull up

122
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,178
pull up

123
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,140
pull up

124
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,340
hey what's going on?

125
00:08:41,143 --> 00:08:42,143
pull up

126
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:45,319
pull up

127
00:08:48,464 --> 00:08:49,464
no no no

128
00:09:05,585 --> 00:09:08,285
we have a plane into a house
heavy fire

129
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:09,839
we have a lot of wires down

130
00:09:15,384 --> 00:09:19,620
execuflight 1526 has crashed
into a two story residential building

131
00:09:26,345 --> 00:09:28,105
everyone on board is dead

132
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:36,183
the NTSB must now determine
what caused this fatal?

133
00:09:41,739 --> 00:09:46,298
execuflight 1526 plunged into a
residential neighborhood in Akron, Ohio

134
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,340
incredibly

135
00:09:50,781 --> 00:09:53,319
none of the residences
were home during the crash

136
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,860
but the neighborhood is on edge

137
00:09:56,302 --> 00:09:58,202
you just don't think
of a plane would drop

138
00:09:58,299 --> 00:10:01,299
in a residential area like this
this is crazy

139
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,500
looks like the
left wing hit first

140
00:10:11,182 --> 00:10:14,263
when NTSB investigators
arrived on scene

141
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:17,366
they notice a large gouge
leading to the crash site

142
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:32,999
one of the first thing I notice as walking
up was a large gouge in the front yard

143
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,899
in front of one of
the town homes

144
00:10:36,783 --> 00:10:40,879
it obviously told me that there was
a control problem with this airplane

145
00:10:41,061 --> 00:10:42,341
on the approach

146
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,140
flaps at 45

147
00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:54,979
investigators closely
examine the wreckage

148
00:10:54,982 --> 00:10:57,683
to determine how the
plane was configured

149
00:10:59,224 --> 00:11:03,124
one of the things that we did learn
very early on was flaps were at a

150
00:11:03,141 --> 00:11:07,203
45 degree or 4
configuration for this landing

151
00:11:09,618 --> 00:11:11,621
we knew they were trying to land

152
00:11:12,821 --> 00:11:13,821
so

153
00:11:14,262 --> 00:11:15,462
they configure the land

154
00:11:16,223 --> 00:11:18,780
then they crashed less than
two miles from the runway

155
00:11:22,142 --> 00:11:23,142
why?

156
00:11:24,619 --> 00:11:26,752
let's take a look at the engines

157
00:11:34,462 --> 00:11:37,544
did the engines fail as the
plane approach the airport?

158
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:40,999
it's a pretty bad shape

159
00:11:42,862 --> 00:11:46,223
one of the things that we were looking for
with the engines at the accident site was

160
00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:47,579
if there were operating

161
00:11:49,491 --> 00:11:52,540
really wanted to see if there was
dirt concrete bits that type of thing

162
00:11:53,061 --> 00:11:54,061
inside the engine

163
00:11:55,903 --> 00:11:57,903
it's like a building insulation

164
00:11:59,499 --> 00:12:00,499
soil

165
00:12:02,862 --> 00:12:06,944
those gave us indications and add
impact these things were producing power

166
00:12:09,347 --> 00:12:14,419
the NTSB is no further ahead in
solving the mystery of flight 1526

167
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:20,059
a team is dispatched
to air traffic control

168
00:12:21,181 --> 00:12:23,781
hoping the controller
can provide some insight

169
00:12:27,106 --> 00:12:28,106
no mayday call

170
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,060
nothing unusual

171
00:12:33,903 --> 00:12:34,903
well

172
00:12:35,304 --> 00:12:37,964
they were delayed by a
piper that was ahead of them

173
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,240
I instructed them
to change heading

174
00:12:40,381 --> 00:12:41,381
reduce speed

175
00:12:41,781 --> 00:12:42,821
and maintain

176
00:12:43,182 --> 00:12:44,182
3000

177
00:12:44,584 --> 00:12:45,624
until cleared

178
00:12:45,979 --> 00:12:48,879
which I did it
14:49:22

179
00:12:49,062 --> 00:12:50,762
when they were 5 miles out

180
00:12:52,463 --> 00:12:54,463
zipline 1526
the piper is on the ground

181
00:12:54,979 --> 00:12:56,999
you are clear for
localize at 25 approach

182
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:01,179
the piper didn't
affect their landing

183
00:13:03,662 --> 00:13:05,362
the piper was on the ground

184
00:13:05,383 --> 00:13:09,287
when the business jet was
still about 5 miles from the airport

185
00:13:09,627 --> 00:13:11,627
ample distance
for a safe landing

186
00:13:18,603 --> 00:13:22,702
at the crash site investigators comb
through the wreckage for more clues

187
00:13:25,584 --> 00:13:26,584
what I needed to know was

188
00:13:27,024 --> 00:13:29,291
was there anything in
the accident wreckage

189
00:13:30,219 --> 00:13:32,782
that was recoverable from
an operational standpoint

190
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:37,023
the material that the pilots used

191
00:13:38,105 --> 00:13:40,505
the cockpit
things that can be documented

192
00:13:40,668 --> 00:13:42,468
that's what I wanted to see

193
00:13:46,141 --> 00:13:47,141
hey check this out

194
00:13:49,978 --> 00:13:53,121
we found manuals that pilots
were required to have on board

195
00:13:55,342 --> 00:13:56,342
this is something

196
00:13:58,705 --> 00:13:59,705
grab an evidence bag

197
00:14:01,266 --> 00:14:04,519
it was damaged and it was burnt
but we were able to examine it

198
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:14,361
investigators then make the
most significant discoveries so far

199
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:23,101
we found angle of attack
indicator in the cockpit wreckage

200
00:14:23,141 --> 00:14:25,983
that's important because
at the certain angle of attack

201
00:14:26,063 --> 00:14:27,263
wing will stall

202
00:14:30,861 --> 00:14:31,861
what angle were you?

203
00:14:34,785 --> 00:14:36,985
it was damaged extensively

204
00:14:37,026 --> 00:14:39,301
but I could see that the
needle was in the red band

205
00:14:44,624 --> 00:14:47,246
when the angle of attack
indicates that it's in the red

206
00:14:47,426 --> 00:14:48,426
you stall

207
00:14:48,426 --> 00:14:50,526
another words
this wing was no longer flying

208
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:52,541
as simple as that

209
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:57,602
investigators determine that the
plane stalled as it approach the airport

210
00:15:00,742 --> 00:15:02,742
now they must understand
why?

211
00:15:03,264 --> 00:15:04,264
pull up

212
00:15:04,424 --> 00:15:05,424
pull up

213
00:15:10,383 --> 00:15:12,383
that's great
get that to Washington

214
00:15:13,784 --> 00:15:17,884
the cockpit voice recorder from
execuflight Flight 1526 is recovered

215
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,760
and sent to NTSB
headquarters for analysis

216
00:15:22,783 --> 00:15:26,683
when we found out the aircraft did have
a cockpit voice recorder, the first thing

217
00:15:26,831 --> 00:15:30,060
we were very interested in doing is
making sure it got back to our labs

218
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,380
I didn't know if we
had good information

219
00:15:35,779 --> 00:15:38,179
the CVR is doubly
important in this case

220
00:15:38,594 --> 00:15:41,739
since the Hawker 700 wasn't
equipped with the flight data recorder

221
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,680
flight data recorders are incredibly
important because they give us a

222
00:15:46,884 --> 00:15:51,339
no question look and precisely what the
flight dynamics were all the way to impact

223
00:15:54,743 --> 00:15:56,743
this investigations are
like a jigsaw puzzle and

224
00:15:57,824 --> 00:15:59,504
with the flight data recorder

225
00:15:59,545 --> 00:16:02,777
the pieces of puzzles are much
bigger and easier to put together

226
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:06,642
but not having a flight data recorder it
didn't give us a whole lot of information

227
00:16:07,182 --> 00:16:09,182
early on in the investigation

228
00:16:10,866 --> 00:16:13,238
while investigators wait
for the voice recording

229
00:16:13,659 --> 00:16:15,659
they worked with what they have

230
00:16:15,722 --> 00:16:17,902
the documents found
in the cockpit wreckage

231
00:16:19,947 --> 00:16:20,947
the weight and balanced

232
00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:23,059
look at that

233
00:16:25,422 --> 00:16:30,842
we found that the weight and balance
didn't account for the auxiliary power unit

234
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:32,078
say

235
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:36,542
a little jet engine in the back that helps
power the aircraft when it's on the ground

236
00:16:37,544 --> 00:16:39,044
so they had no APU

237
00:16:42,578 --> 00:16:46,701
the team wonders how this compares
to what they discovered at the crash site

238
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,100
hello APU

239
00:16:54,622 --> 00:16:58,799
we saw that the APU was on board
cause we found it on the wreckage

240
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,943
looks like they were carrying
more weight than they thought

241
00:17:04,704 --> 00:17:07,160
investigators believed
they found an error

242
00:17:07,219 --> 00:17:10,119
in the plane's documented
weight and balance

243
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,680
were they too heavy?

244
00:17:13,461 --> 00:17:15,661
I wonder how much this
plane truly weight

245
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:22,022
the pilots made their calculations
without accounting for an APU

246
00:17:22,824 --> 00:17:24,824
but there clearly
was one on board

247
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,740
we certainly had a concern about

248
00:17:28,742 --> 00:17:32,390
weather or not the airplane
was within its weight and balance

249
00:17:32,665 --> 00:17:37,165
the NTSB calculates the actual
weight of the plane during its final flight

250
00:17:39,422 --> 00:17:41,022
the APU weights 300 pounds

251
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:50,860
and according to the aircraft refueler
they were loaded with 8160 pounds of fuel

252
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,560
but they only burn down 7700

253
00:17:55,504 --> 00:17:58,463
so how much in total
were they over by?

254
00:17:59,981 --> 00:18:02,481
they were only 286
pounds over weight

255
00:18:04,782 --> 00:18:09,290
the plane's actual weight was slightly
more than what the pilots recorded

256
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:15,242
it wouldn't really made a
performance difference on the aircraft

257
00:18:16,019 --> 00:18:19,619
the weight of the APU and the
additional fuel was not enough

258
00:18:19,702 --> 00:18:22,235
to effect the balance
of the airplane

259
00:18:23,064 --> 00:18:27,464
but it did tell us that this crew in this
company wasn't following their procedures

260
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,540
appropriately

261
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,341
somebody wasn't watching what
they were supposed to be doing

262
00:18:33,099 --> 00:18:38,783
investigators need to look elsewhere
to explain why flight 1526 stall

263
00:18:40,184 --> 00:18:42,984
we knew that there is not a
flight data recorder on this airplane

264
00:18:43,145 --> 00:18:48,045
so that's frustrating because we don't
have the precise details about the airspeed

265
00:18:48,222 --> 00:18:50,744
the altitude and
attitude of the aircraft

266
00:18:51,624 --> 00:18:53,024
to solve the case

267
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:56,065
the NTSB begins compiling
what data they do have

268
00:18:56,939 --> 00:18:59,139
the radar data from
air traffic control

269
00:19:01,978 --> 00:19:03,978
show me what you've got so far

270
00:19:06,221 --> 00:19:08,721
a turning point in investigation
came when our our engineer

271
00:19:08,724 --> 00:19:13,361
was able to recreate our aircraft
performance from the radar data

272
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:18,739
okay

273
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:23,601
they're 150 knots
4 minutes before the crash

274
00:19:26,668 --> 00:19:27,668
keep going

275
00:19:29,699 --> 00:19:34,539
our aircraft performance expert was able
to estimate the air speed, the airplane

276
00:19:34,658 --> 00:19:38,579
the angle of attack, the attitude
the altitude and rate of descent

277
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:44,081
as a plane approach to airport

278
00:19:44,222 --> 00:19:46,422
you expect the
airspeed to decrease

279
00:19:47,345 --> 00:19:51,345
it drops from 300 down to 150
everything normal

280
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:57,398
investigators find nothing
unusual about the flight

281
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:00,310
until they focus on
the last two minutes

282
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:02,701
look here

283
00:20:02,983 --> 00:20:06,939
the speed drops to 130 knots
and then keeps dropping to 98 knots

284
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,340
no wonder they stall

285
00:20:12,261 --> 00:20:15,061
the thing that really stood out
was the excessive rate of descent

286
00:20:15,063 --> 00:20:16,663
at the very end was 98 knots

287
00:20:17,304 --> 00:20:19,304
which is gonna
stall the airplane

288
00:20:22,101 --> 00:20:23,101
airspeed is life

289
00:20:24,062 --> 00:20:27,062
it's one most important point of
flying any airplane but specially

290
00:20:27,544 --> 00:20:29,544
specially a jet

291
00:20:30,379 --> 00:20:32,380
maybe they were trying
to stay clear the piper

292
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:35,619
I doubt it

293
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:39,460
controller told them the runway
was clear 3 minutes before it stalled

294
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,823
the airspeed data leaves
investigators with more questions

295
00:20:46,504 --> 00:20:48,604
let's look at the altitude data

296
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,300
the team reviews the
plane's descent profile

297
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,710
for the period
leading up to the crash

298
00:20:57,981 --> 00:21:00,481
the early part of the
descent looks pretty normal

299
00:21:01,383 --> 00:21:03,383
they're doing a dive
and drive approach

300
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,940
they level off at 9000
5000, 4000

301
00:21:08,744 --> 00:21:10,844
but look that
that's odd

302
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:12,541
you blow that up

303
00:21:16,019 --> 00:21:18,019
they make an important discovery

304
00:21:20,262 --> 00:21:21,262
look

305
00:21:21,304 --> 00:21:24,304
they hold it 3000 feet
for an entire two minute

306
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,260
that's way too long

307
00:21:26,662 --> 00:21:28,662
and then they plunged steeply

308
00:21:31,739 --> 00:21:34,763
bring up the final approach
they were supposed to take

309
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:43,041
it's not even close

310
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:48,960
on normal approaches of the glide
path allows the airplane to descent

311
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:52,628
general 3 degree path all
the way down to the runway

312
00:21:52,982 --> 00:21:56,104
looks like they started
their final approach too late

313
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:58,930
and then after
race to catch up

314
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,760
the data shows that after
delaying their approach

315
00:22:02,902 --> 00:22:05,402
the pilots descended
very steeply

316
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,420
and at twice the normal rate

317
00:22:08,261 --> 00:22:11,361
once they started diving the
airplane down to 2000 feet a minute

318
00:22:11,384 --> 00:22:14,526
to get to that lower altitude
that approach was unstable

319
00:22:15,066 --> 00:22:18,139
and at that point of time they
should have executed to go around

320
00:22:19,262 --> 00:22:20,762
controller told us

321
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:23,384
they acknowledged
his instruction to descent

322
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:28,020
zipline 1526
the piper is on the ground

323
00:22:28,382 --> 00:22:30,382
you are clear for localize
25 approach

324
00:22:30,863 --> 00:22:32,543
clear for localize at 25
thank you

325
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:37,060
they're clear to descent
and then they wait

326
00:22:38,381 --> 00:22:39,661
full two minutes

327
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:41,943
why?

328
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:48,282
we really wondered what is the
situation in the cockpit at that time

329
00:22:53,187 --> 00:22:58,201
NTSB investigators turn to the
cockpit voice recorder from flight 1526

330
00:22:58,821 --> 00:23:02,821
to understand why the pilots
delayed their final descent into Akron

331
00:23:03,899 --> 00:23:06,440
take it from the first
instruction about that piper

332
00:23:10,383 --> 00:23:14,446
zipline 1526 we do have an aircraft inbound
to the airport that is slower than you

333
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:19,122
flight heading 360
reduce speed 170

334
00:23:19,181 --> 00:23:20,861
descend and maintain 3000

335
00:23:21,744 --> 00:23:24,107
down to 3000
170 is the speed

336
00:23:24,587 --> 00:23:27,320
and 360
zipline 1526

337
00:23:29,381 --> 00:23:31,881
down to 3000
he want 170 knots

338
00:23:32,504 --> 00:23:33,504
okay

339
00:23:39,242 --> 00:23:42,942
somebody lower the landing gear to
start slowing the airplane up and creating

340
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:45,583
drag to hopefully get
a little bit more spacing

341
00:23:46,104 --> 00:23:48,164
between them and
the other airplane

342
00:23:49,508 --> 00:23:51,408
did you hear what he's said?

343
00:23:51,459 --> 00:23:53,259
there is another
plane on the approach

344
00:23:53,261 --> 00:23:56,283
it's slower than us, we don't
know if it's on the ground yet

345
00:23:58,304 --> 00:24:02,804
the captain was very concern about
the space between them and training flight

346
00:24:02,939 --> 00:24:04,939
and was saying
that to the copilot

347
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:10,250
did you hear that?

348
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:14,226
investigators hear the sound
of engine trust decreasing

349
00:24:15,306 --> 00:24:17,306
let's see the airspeed again

350
00:24:21,784 --> 00:24:26,201
the airspeed drops
from 170 down to 140

351
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,424
that's way slower than
you need to be going

352
00:24:34,425 --> 00:24:35,425
look
you're going 140

353
00:24:36,982 --> 00:24:39,982
zipline 1526
the piper is on the ground

354
00:24:40,109 --> 00:24:41,789
you're clear for localize
25 approach

355
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,260
clear for localize at 25
thank you

356
00:24:46,504 --> 00:24:48,504
flight 1526 is now at 3000 feet

357
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:52,620
and position to flight
straight into Akron airport

358
00:24:54,146 --> 00:24:56,146
they should start their descent

359
00:24:58,069 --> 00:25:02,820
why did the pilots delay their descent
for 2 minutes forcing them to catch up?

360
00:25:05,344 --> 00:25:06,344
you're going 120

361
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,300
you can't keep
decreasing your speed

362
00:25:09,903 --> 00:25:13,866
once the copilot received a warning
from the captain that they were too slow

363
00:25:14,411 --> 00:25:18,363
the copilot should have
increased thrust significantly

364
00:25:18,363 --> 00:25:20,463
but instead the
pilots get into a debate

365
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:23,786
120
when you get 120?

366
00:25:24,308 --> 00:25:25,308
it's more like 125

367
00:25:25,942 --> 00:25:27,242
which is the approach speed

368
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,020
but you still got
the flaps to go

369
00:25:29,101 --> 00:25:30,101
when they go down

370
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:32,629
this is what I'm saying if you
continue decreasing your speed

371
00:25:32,723 --> 00:25:33,723
but why?

372
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,845
because we're gonna stall
I don't wanna stall

373
00:25:35,866 --> 00:25:36,866
how do we ...

374
00:25:37,738 --> 00:25:38,738
stop

375
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,443
they are so busy
arguing about their speed

376
00:25:43,226 --> 00:25:45,526
that they forget to
start their descent

377
00:25:47,182 --> 00:25:50,784
there is about 2 minutes of conversation
concerning the airplane speed

378
00:25:50,823 --> 00:25:56,178
the pilot and first officer were actually
argument that they was getting too slow

379
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,820
they delay of almost
2 minutes was critical

380
00:26:00,903 --> 00:26:05,145
he's already too slow and he's
over flown the altitude it should be in

381
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,690
now they've got to
chase the approach

382
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,460
now he's got to get
the airplane down fast

383
00:26:11,943 --> 00:26:12,943
okay

384
00:26:13,063 --> 00:26:16,099
what investigators hear
next is even more shocking

385
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,883
hey guys
we just landed on the localizer

386
00:26:19,982 --> 00:26:21,582
and broke out right at minimum

387
00:26:23,344 --> 00:26:26,939
they were notified that the smaller
airplane had landed safely on the runway

388
00:26:30,582 --> 00:26:31,582
full flaps

389
00:26:36,901 --> 00:26:37,901
stop

390
00:26:38,745 --> 00:26:41,245
full flaps at that speed
what was he thinking?

391
00:26:41,584 --> 00:26:43,584
bring up the
altitude graph again

392
00:26:49,702 --> 00:26:52,798
okay that's why the plane
starts to drop like a rock

393
00:26:55,221 --> 00:26:59,021
the team finally
understands why flight 1526

394
00:26:59,143 --> 00:27:01,705
ended up in a 2000
feet per minute descent

395
00:27:02,258 --> 00:27:04,158
twice the recommended rate

396
00:27:06,101 --> 00:27:09,826
the first officer was racing to
get the plane back on course

397
00:27:10,626 --> 00:27:11,626
the airplane is too high

398
00:27:12,061 --> 00:27:13,061
is too slow

399
00:27:13,463 --> 00:27:16,363
and with full flaps
rather than partial flaps

400
00:27:16,823 --> 00:27:18,556
they really needed
to get down in a hurry

401
00:27:19,303 --> 00:27:21,803
and really that is a
turning point when we said

402
00:27:21,821 --> 00:27:24,488
this airplane is not configure
properly for the approach

403
00:27:24,944 --> 00:27:29,025
and this puts the crew and
passengers in really a lot of danger

404
00:27:31,986 --> 00:27:33,888
he should have just
called the missed approach

405
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:34,985
try it again

406
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:42,670
investigators now need to understand why
the pilots continue their dangerous descent

407
00:27:44,304 --> 00:27:47,373
when we look at the
errors that the pilots made

408
00:27:47,983 --> 00:27:49,483
we really had to wonder

409
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:51,201
what was their background?

410
00:27:54,183 --> 00:27:58,659
NTSB investigators Sathya Silver
examines the pilots' personnel records

411
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:03,002
to see if they explain their
behavior on the day of the accident

412
00:28:04,554 --> 00:28:07,561
the first officer had more
than 4000 hours of flight time

413
00:28:07,901 --> 00:28:09,901
he was the pilot in
command for 3200 hours

414
00:28:11,283 --> 00:28:13,283
and he passed all his courses

415
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,580
yep

416
00:28:15,822 --> 00:28:16,822
yeah just turned 50

417
00:28:17,503 --> 00:28:19,524
no sign of drug or
alcohol in the system

418
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,460
but

419
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,980
take a look at this

420
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:27,863
looks like he flew all night
two nights before the accident

421
00:28:28,385 --> 00:28:30,385
could it have been fatigue?

422
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,720
for the first officer
what we found was

423
00:28:33,742 --> 00:28:36,584
he did not have the
rest several days earlier

424
00:28:37,063 --> 00:28:39,300
that regulation required

425
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,140
see what the airline has to say

426
00:28:43,262 --> 00:28:48,362
so we wanted to take a look and
see if a chronic fatigue problem

427
00:28:48,499 --> 00:28:51,899
may have manifested itself
several days later to hopefully

428
00:28:52,062 --> 00:28:56,120
explain why this crew and particularly
first officer was making so many mistakes

429
00:28:59,622 --> 00:29:01,622
thanks for coming in
happy to help out

430
00:29:03,024 --> 00:29:06,524
silver interviews execuflight
Donnie Shackleford

431
00:29:06,627 --> 00:29:10,240
who had flown with first officer
Marchese leading up to the crash

432
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:15,283
tell me about your last
flight with the first officer

433
00:29:17,864 --> 00:29:20,899
two days before the accident
we flew into Fort Lauderdale

434
00:29:27,705 --> 00:29:29,790
they want me to fly
to Mexico over night

435
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,780
like now

436
00:29:33,581 --> 00:29:37,584
that would me fine to go
considering the duty time issue

437
00:29:37,744 --> 00:29:40,460
as long as they remained
overnight in Mexico

438
00:29:43,903 --> 00:29:44,903
so

439
00:29:45,023 --> 00:29:47,063
did he sleep
overnight in Mexico?

440
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,800
nope
came right back before Lauderdale

441
00:29:52,304 --> 00:29:55,004
I talked to him the
night before the crash

442
00:29:55,101 --> 00:29:58,042
he told me that he was
worn out from the other trip

443
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:02,387
even though he was legal as far as the
number of hours between he was not rested

444
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,901
he should not have
been on that flight

445
00:30:09,667 --> 00:30:13,167
the fact that the first officer
had to fly an overnight flight

446
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,804
and not sleep when
his body wanted to sleep

447
00:30:15,864 --> 00:30:17,864
resulted in circadian disruption

448
00:30:19,503 --> 00:30:21,503
we know that human
beings have limits

449
00:30:22,301 --> 00:30:25,601
if you're not getting the appropriate
sleep over time your attitude

450
00:30:25,661 --> 00:30:29,103
can go to the heck in a hand-basket
and that can crash airplanes

451
00:30:30,185 --> 00:30:33,685
because the first officer did
have the required amount of sleep

452
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:35,439
the night before the crash

453
00:30:35,463 --> 00:30:38,981
investigators can't definitively
point to sleep deprivation

454
00:30:39,141 --> 00:30:41,524
as the cause of their
poor decision making

455
00:30:43,663 --> 00:30:46,663
there is something about
the flight that still trouble silver

456
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:51,807
how often would the first
officer be the pilot flying?

457
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:54,990
only if there were
no paying passengers

458
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,820
why?

459
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,380
company policy

460
00:31:00,385 --> 00:31:02,085
the company did have
a procedure to enable

461
00:31:02,166 --> 00:31:04,930
first officer to get
experience flying the aircraft

462
00:31:05,028 --> 00:31:08,681
and those were in empty legs
where passengers weren't on board

463
00:31:10,663 --> 00:31:12,463
Renato should not
have been flying

464
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,410
it should have been Oscar

465
00:31:15,987 --> 00:31:20,182
Silva discovers that the captain
violated standard operating procedures

466
00:31:21,864 --> 00:31:26,264
what we don't know and what is a
little confusing is why in this case

467
00:31:26,379 --> 00:31:28,879
when you had
passengers in the back

468
00:31:28,945 --> 00:31:31,945
you had weather that
was gonna be a factor and

469
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:35,351
an approach that was gonna
be relatively challenging

470
00:31:36,548 --> 00:31:39,705
why this captain decided to
allow that his first officer to fly?

471
00:31:44,985 --> 00:31:49,685
the NTSB wants to know why
captain Chávez broke company policy

472
00:31:49,868 --> 00:31:53,380
allowing his first officer flying
the plane with clients on board

473
00:31:54,944 --> 00:31:56,444
take a look at this

474
00:31:57,625 --> 00:31:59,705
the captain didn't
get much sleep either

475
00:32:00,509 --> 00:32:02,700
he got a full night
sleep before the crash

476
00:32:03,304 --> 00:32:06,804
but he didn't get a full 8
hours for 4 nights before that

477
00:32:08,386 --> 00:32:10,286
maybe he was also fatigue

478
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:11,387
that's possible

479
00:32:13,219 --> 00:32:17,641
as we looked for their back
into his records it looks like

480
00:32:18,025 --> 00:32:19,225
the days prior

481
00:32:19,424 --> 00:32:22,424
he actually only averaged
about 6 hours of sleep

482
00:32:24,501 --> 00:32:28,701
investigators listen for any indication
of fatigue on the cockpit voice recorder

483
00:32:29,583 --> 00:32:33,783
let's pick up where we left off
the start of a final descent

484
00:32:36,584 --> 00:32:38,584
descending from 3000 feet

485
00:32:38,859 --> 00:32:41,159
the crew begins
their landing checklist

486
00:32:44,465 --> 00:32:45,465
ignition

487
00:32:45,585 --> 00:32:46,965
everything is all set

488
00:32:47,009 --> 00:32:48,009
stand by

489
00:32:48,379 --> 00:32:49,379
fuel damper

490
00:32:49,499 --> 00:32:50,499
auto pilot

491
00:32:55,781 --> 00:32:56,981
he just stopped

492
00:32:57,342 --> 00:32:59,342
in the middle of
his landing checklist

493
00:33:00,107 --> 00:33:01,107
it's like he's distracted

494
00:33:03,788 --> 00:33:06,088
there were checklist that
were supposed to be done

495
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:09,460
all the way through we
found on cockpit voice recorder

496
00:33:09,944 --> 00:33:13,919
all the checklist that they should have
complied with were never completed

497
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:16,659
instead of finishing
the checklist

498
00:33:16,741 --> 00:33:20,242
the captain's focus turns
to the plane's erratic descent

499
00:33:20,703 --> 00:33:21,703
you're diving
don't dive

500
00:33:22,979 --> 00:33:24,979
2000 feet per minute
body

501
00:33:26,023 --> 00:33:27,023
yeah

502
00:33:27,583 --> 00:33:28,583
2000 feet per minute

503
00:33:28,643 --> 00:33:30,643
don't go 2000 feet per minute

504
00:33:30,945 --> 00:33:31,945
with me there?

505
00:33:33,187 --> 00:33:36,987
the copilot was being
coached so much by this captain

506
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:41,024
that at this point, this is the very
serious portion of the approach

507
00:33:41,343 --> 00:33:44,406
you're gonna go down
into weather that's very low

508
00:33:44,706 --> 00:33:46,306
and very significant

509
00:33:47,267 --> 00:33:49,067
the captain should
have taken control

510
00:33:51,741 --> 00:33:54,542
when it's time for the captain
to say I've got the airplane

511
00:33:54,582 --> 00:33:56,284
cause you're not
performing well enough

512
00:33:56,303 --> 00:33:58,284
there should be no
question and no hesitation

513
00:34:00,499 --> 00:34:01,999
why wouldn't he take over?

514
00:34:04,503 --> 00:34:08,100
investigators hear more than the
effects of fatigue on the recording

515
00:34:10,102 --> 00:34:12,102
by having the first officer fly

516
00:34:12,943 --> 00:34:14,443
this captain then

517
00:34:14,624 --> 00:34:18,139
was dividing his time being a
captain and also being an instructor

518
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:22,662
we found he wasn't appropriately
managing the cockpit as a captain

519
00:34:25,305 --> 00:34:28,358
don't go 2000 feet per minute when
you're 500 feet above the ground

520
00:34:32,582 --> 00:34:34,582
bring up the
altitude graph again

521
00:34:39,022 --> 00:34:41,022
they're less than
500 feet off the ground

522
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,860
it's below their
minimum descent altitude

523
00:34:46,104 --> 00:34:49,464
it's critical that you do not
descent below that altitude

524
00:34:50,306 --> 00:34:55,020
until you have a visual view
of the airport or the runway

525
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:00,463
but they continue to descent

526
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:02,860
ground

527
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:06,220
god, he can see the
ground but not runway

528
00:35:08,743 --> 00:35:10,743
they're coming
down from 3000 feet

529
00:35:10,885 --> 00:35:12,926
they've got to get to the
minimum descent altitude

530
00:35:12,947 --> 00:35:14,947
which is only 500
feet above the ground

531
00:35:15,219 --> 00:35:17,779
there is not much room to
work with if you screw this up

532
00:35:21,103 --> 00:35:22,103
keep going

533
00:35:22,544 --> 00:35:25,744
the CVR reveals that the captain
violated a fundamental rule

534
00:35:26,741 --> 00:35:29,222
by continuing descent
without a runway insight

535
00:35:31,184 --> 00:35:34,551
you don't see the field
then you do a go around

536
00:35:35,403 --> 00:35:38,003
because the pilot was
still looking for the airport

537
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,740
while descending
below minimum altitude

538
00:35:41,219 --> 00:35:43,499
neither of them notice
they're decaying airspeed

539
00:35:44,902 --> 00:35:45,902
okay level up now
got it

540
00:35:49,424 --> 00:35:50,424
pull up

541
00:35:50,919 --> 00:35:53,000
they've been too slow
for the last little while

542
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:56,460
and they don't recognize even
with stick shaker banging away

543
00:35:56,543 --> 00:35:58,243
then they are aerodynamic stall

544
00:35:59,025 --> 00:36:00,025
pull up

545
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,620
that doomed them

546
00:36:05,245 --> 00:36:07,245
they weren't able to
recover from the stall

547
00:36:27,983 --> 00:36:28,983
this is perfect stall

548
00:36:29,502 --> 00:36:30,502
of their own making

549
00:36:33,183 --> 00:36:36,683
investigators find enough evidence
on the voice recording to conclude

550
00:36:36,825 --> 00:36:40,780
that fatigue was likely one component
of the crew's poor decision making

551
00:36:42,462 --> 00:36:43,462
we found that

552
00:36:43,903 --> 00:36:47,524
the captain's behavior could
have been attributed to fatigue

553
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:49,980
but fatigue alone

554
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:54,382
doesn't explain the long list of
botched procedures on flight 1526

555
00:36:56,059 --> 00:36:59,059
they broke so many rules, makes
you wonder who trained them

556
00:37:01,422 --> 00:37:03,322
they weren't following
their procedures

557
00:37:03,385 --> 00:37:05,685
they missed
checklist and call outs

558
00:37:06,739 --> 00:37:08,739
they've got the wrong
way on the approach

559
00:37:09,021 --> 00:37:11,421
they were flying in
the wrong configuration

560
00:37:12,103 --> 00:37:15,105
we decided to go back and
take a look at their training

561
00:37:15,505 --> 00:37:18,507
what was it that led up to
them making these mistakes?

562
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:28,442
the NTSB orders up the
employment and training records

563
00:37:28,661 --> 00:37:31,861
of the crew of flight
1526 for the last five years

564
00:37:33,983 --> 00:37:36,016
you're not gonna believe this

565
00:37:38,223 --> 00:37:40,223
they are shocked
by what they find

566
00:37:41,306 --> 00:37:43,306
the captain's termination notice

567
00:37:43,584 --> 00:37:45,584
says that he was
fired from his last job

568
00:37:47,227 --> 00:37:49,727
investigators learned that
the captain was dismissed

569
00:37:50,069 --> 00:37:52,069
because he failed
to show up for training

570
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:54,460
get this

571
00:37:54,861 --> 00:37:58,901
the first officer was terminated because
his performance was below standard

572
00:38:01,022 --> 00:38:05,083
the first officer was let go because
he struggle during flight training

573
00:38:06,059 --> 00:38:08,059
both these guys
had training issues

574
00:38:08,342 --> 00:38:10,342
and were fired because of them

575
00:38:10,898 --> 00:38:12,898
and execuflight knew about it

576
00:38:14,581 --> 00:38:17,181
the captain's fire
employment was suspect

577
00:38:17,663 --> 00:38:20,163
in terms of why was he dismissed

578
00:38:20,739 --> 00:38:23,139
the first officer's hiring
in this particular case

579
00:38:23,302 --> 00:38:25,302
smacks of just warm body hiring

580
00:38:25,863 --> 00:38:29,163
having somebody with 98 degree
temperature putting in the right seat

581
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,260
and say we've got a
copilot cause he's licensed

582
00:38:32,661 --> 00:38:33,661
so

583
00:38:34,343 --> 00:38:36,343
why did execuflight
hire these guys?

584
00:38:39,102 --> 00:38:40,302
we start to wonder

585
00:38:40,463 --> 00:38:43,838
did the company know
about these deficiency?

586
00:38:43,867 --> 00:38:45,867
if they did
did they address them?

587
00:38:47,781 --> 00:38:49,281
okay, thanks again
bye

588
00:38:52,545 --> 00:38:54,545
I just got off the phone
with the president

589
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,593
he said he knew about their history
but hired them anyway

590
00:39:00,946 --> 00:39:04,346
the president of execuflight
said that he'd hired the captain

591
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:07,183
because of his extensive
experience in the Hawker aircraft

592
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:10,040
as well as flights that had
personally taken with the captain

593
00:39:12,348 --> 00:39:14,348
prior to his employment

594
00:39:15,181 --> 00:39:19,888
the first officer was hired based on
a recommendation from another pilot

595
00:39:20,223 --> 00:39:22,723
as well as one flight that he
had taken with him personally

596
00:39:24,424 --> 00:39:26,963
he said that they didn't
contact their previous employers

597
00:39:28,942 --> 00:39:32,842
it's very very important in hiring
a pilot to do what the law says

598
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:34,864
and what the regulation say

599
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:38,019
contact the previous employers
and have an opportunity

600
00:39:38,021 --> 00:39:39,821
to know if this individual
has some bad habits

601
00:39:39,903 --> 00:39:42,847
that you strongly don't
want in your operation

602
00:39:43,305 --> 00:39:45,305
execuflight did give
them CRM training

603
00:39:46,938 --> 00:39:50,038
basically cockpit resource
management training is

604
00:39:50,861 --> 00:39:53,361
teaching pilots
to work as a team

605
00:39:53,703 --> 00:39:56,303
and using all the
available tools together

606
00:39:56,825 --> 00:39:58,825
so they are operating as one

607
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:04,183
but when the investigators examine
the airline CRM training program

608
00:40:04,744 --> 00:40:06,244
they are underwhelmed

609
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,400
not much of a training manual

610
00:40:10,982 --> 00:40:15,882
the regulations required execuflight to
have cockpit resource management training

611
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,060
and it did

612
00:40:17,062 --> 00:40:19,903
what we found was their
training was insufficient

613
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:23,600
and their evaluation of
the crew was not proper

614
00:40:26,262 --> 00:40:28,862
this was an accident
waiting to happen

615
00:40:49,421 --> 00:40:51,421
the NTSB concludes

616
00:40:51,602 --> 00:40:54,002
that the probable
cause of the crash

617
00:40:54,061 --> 00:40:56,661
was the crew's
mismanagement of their approach

618
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,780
deviation from
operating procedures

619
00:41:00,582 --> 00:41:03,660
and execuflight's lax
hiring and training practices

620
00:41:06,462 --> 00:41:08,962
we determine that
execuflight did not

621
00:41:09,144 --> 00:41:11,044
enforce and didn't

622
00:41:11,067 --> 00:41:15,483
make sure that the pilots were
following standard operating procedures

623
00:41:18,383 --> 00:41:22,283
in their report, the NTSB
makes several recommendations

624
00:41:22,345 --> 00:41:24,345
for private operators
like execuflight

625
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:30,083
they include better training for
pilots on non precision approaches

626
00:41:30,123 --> 00:41:31,803
like the one into Akron

627
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:35,320
and the installation
of flight data recorders

628
00:41:35,402 --> 00:41:38,601
that could also be used to
monitor the progress of their flights

629
00:41:39,821 --> 00:41:42,621
the NTSB recommendations
really comes down to

630
00:41:42,663 --> 00:41:45,163
what kind of scrutiny
you have on your pilots

631
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,820
do you know what's
going on in a cockpit?

632
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:49,000
do you know what
your pilots are doing?

633
00:41:49,942 --> 00:41:51,942
standard operating procedures

634
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,100
these are incredibly important

635
00:41:54,181 --> 00:41:56,181
it's like we say
airspeed is life, well

636
00:41:56,464 --> 00:41:59,320
adherence the standard
operating procedures is life

637
00:42:00,421 --> 00:42:02,421
and of we begin to
remove the structure

638
00:42:02,701 --> 00:42:05,901
you go back in time and you
lose the benefit of all the lessons

639
00:42:05,964 --> 00:42:09,046
that we have paid so nearly
for in the past by crashes
