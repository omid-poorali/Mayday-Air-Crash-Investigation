1
00:00:01,943 --> 00:00:03,943
on an early morning
take off in Kentucky

2
00:00:04,985 --> 00:00:06,585
100 knots
check

3
00:00:06,987 --> 00:00:10,487
two experienced pilots struggled to
get their regional get off the ground

4
00:00:12,821 --> 00:00:13,821
rotate

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,460
and crashed into a nearby field

6
00:00:22,301 --> 00:00:24,301
this was a catastrophic accident

7
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:26,959
investigators try to piece
together what went wrong

8
00:00:27,421 --> 00:00:28,921
get those to Washington

9
00:00:29,142 --> 00:00:31,542
and end up with more
questions than answers

10
00:00:31,979 --> 00:00:33,979
what the heck could stop there?

11
00:00:34,543 --> 00:00:36,543
only by retracing the taxi route

12
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:38,904
all the cues are right there

13
00:00:38,944 --> 00:00:39,944
plane's site

14
00:00:40,266 --> 00:00:42,766
and listening to the
cockpit discussions

15
00:00:42,779 --> 00:00:44,379
that's weird
with no light

16
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,461
yeah

17
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,580
do investigators
discover the grim truth?

18
00:00:49,544 --> 00:00:52,044
they finally realize
something is wrong

19
00:00:52,661 --> 00:00:53,861
but it's already too late

20
00:01:19,261 --> 00:01:22,261
it's almost 6 in the morning
in Lexington Kentucky

21
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,680
the pilots of Comair Flight 5191

22
00:01:28,782 --> 00:01:30,782
prepare for their
preflight briefing

23
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,120
in command is
captain Jeffrey Clay

24
00:01:35,581 --> 00:01:38,581
an experience pilot with
more than 4700 flying hours

25
00:01:42,346 --> 00:01:45,967
man I was feeling I could eat a little
more when I get a seat belt like this

26
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,780
first officer James Polehinke

27
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:53,756
is a also a seasoned pilot
with more than 6500 flying hours

28
00:01:54,504 --> 00:01:57,004
you up for flying this leg?
yeah I'll take us to Atlanta

29
00:01:58,699 --> 00:02:01,759
both the captain and the first
officer were very highly regarded

30
00:02:02,302 --> 00:02:05,302
an outstanding
professional reputation

31
00:02:05,699 --> 00:02:08,861
and individuals that had flown with
them had nothing but high marks and

32
00:02:09,101 --> 00:02:12,103
and bring very favorable
comments as far as their qualities

33
00:02:13,905 --> 00:02:17,605
the crew is flying a
Bombardier CRJ100

34
00:02:17,828 --> 00:02:20,959
a small twin engine jet designed
for short commuter flights

35
00:02:25,422 --> 00:02:28,822
Shawn Pruchnicki flew that
aircraft for comair for 10 years

36
00:02:30,501 --> 00:02:33,601
the CRJ is an aircraft
that's built for short haul flights

37
00:02:34,464 --> 00:02:37,168
for example the Lexington to
Atlanta less than an hour type flight

38
00:02:37,562 --> 00:02:39,962
it's really what these
planes are designed to do

39
00:02:44,263 --> 00:02:46,183
ladies and gentleman
we'd like to take this time

40
00:02:46,224 --> 00:02:49,224
to welcome you on board
Comair Flight 5191 direct to Atlanta

41
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,880
we'll try to keep this
as quite as possible

42
00:02:51,962 --> 00:02:53,962
hopefully you catch a
nap on the way there

43
00:02:54,544 --> 00:02:56,544
so pleasure having
you on board today

44
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:01,622
they are 47 passengers and
one flight attendant on today's flight

45
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,145
the pilots begin their briefing

46
00:03:09,664 --> 00:03:12,064
take off procedures off of

47
00:03:12,219 --> 00:03:13,719
he said what airline?
24?

48
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,140
it's 22

49
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:18,822
something that we
do prior to take off is

50
00:03:18,945 --> 00:03:22,017
we do a flight briefing
between the two members

51
00:03:22,066 --> 00:03:23,366
primer reason we do this is

52
00:03:23,467 --> 00:03:26,058
to make sure that everyone has
the same amount of information

53
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,260
and knowledge to
safely depart the airport

54
00:03:35,227 --> 00:03:36,227
all right

55
00:03:37,779 --> 00:03:39,779
22 to short taxi
any question?

56
00:03:40,022 --> 00:03:42,022
no questions, before starting
you're leisure

57
00:03:51,499 --> 00:03:54,499
in the cabin passengers
prepare for take off

58
00:03:56,062 --> 00:03:57,562
seat belt
please

59
00:04:01,981 --> 00:04:03,981
today they're bound
for Atlanta Georgia

60
00:04:04,542 --> 00:04:06,342
just a 67 minute flight

61
00:04:06,504 --> 00:04:08,904
straight south from
Lexington Blue Grass Airport

62
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:13,579
comair 191 is ready to taxi

63
00:04:14,983 --> 00:04:17,483
comair 191
taxi to runway 22

64
00:04:18,105 --> 00:04:21,105
altimeter 3000

65
00:04:21,778 --> 00:04:24,778
winds are 200 at 8

66
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:28,181
3000 and taxi to 22
comair 191

67
00:04:28,703 --> 00:04:33,460
Lexington air traffic controller
clears flight 5191 to the runway

68
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:36,741
and then turns his
attention to another plane

69
00:04:37,423 --> 00:04:39,423
eagle flight
runway 22

70
00:04:39,619 --> 00:04:41,219
clear for take off

71
00:04:43,821 --> 00:04:46,021
with few planes
at this small airport

72
00:04:46,383 --> 00:04:47,483
in near perfect weather

73
00:04:47,544 --> 00:04:50,544
this flight is far from challenging
for this seasoned pilots

74
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,900
during the taxi
the captain is responsible

75
00:04:56,041 --> 00:05:00,181
primary for navigating the
aircraft on the airport surface

76
00:05:04,661 --> 00:05:07,661
the first officer is running
numerous checklist

77
00:05:08,064 --> 00:05:10,564
in verifying that the
aircraft is safe for departure

78
00:05:13,422 --> 00:05:15,622
folks, we're gonna be
underway momentarily

79
00:05:15,643 --> 00:05:17,643
so sit back

80
00:05:20,428 --> 00:05:22,108
we're all ready captain

81
00:05:27,143 --> 00:05:28,823
cabin report received

82
00:05:28,864 --> 00:05:30,931
before take off checks complete
ready?

83
00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:32,419
all set

84
00:05:33,702 --> 00:05:35,902
and sure leisure comair 121
ready to go

85
00:05:37,063 --> 00:05:38,063
comair 191

86
00:05:39,059 --> 00:05:40,059
Lexington tower

87
00:05:40,499 --> 00:05:43,032
runway heading
clear for take off

88
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:46,877
runway heading
clear for take off 191

89
00:06:07,983 --> 00:06:10,183
lights set
take off config it's okay

90
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,820
all yours

91
00:06:14,781 --> 00:06:19,125
captain Clay hands control of aircraft
to first officer Polehinke for take off

92
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:21,979
my brakes
my controls

93
00:06:34,441 --> 00:06:35,441
set thrust please

94
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:38,819
thrust set

95
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:53,779
that's weird
with no lights

96
00:07:01,827 --> 00:07:02,827
100 knots
checks

97
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,259
something's not right

98
00:07:09,942 --> 00:07:10,942
rotate

99
00:07:11,023 --> 00:07:12,723
5191 prepares to lift off

100
00:07:20,999 --> 00:07:21,999
damn it

101
00:07:40,982 --> 00:07:44,202
comair flight 5191
hurtles into a field

102
00:07:44,342 --> 00:07:46,342
less than a half of a
mile from the runway

103
00:07:50,821 --> 00:07:52,421
this is Lexington
alert 3

104
00:07:53,104 --> 00:07:54,104
west side of the runway

105
00:07:54,504 --> 00:07:56,504
to the comair
regional jet taking off

106
00:08:05,741 --> 00:08:07,641
we knew something was wrong

107
00:08:07,702 --> 00:08:09,702
we never get an alert 3
we never get one

108
00:08:15,019 --> 00:08:18,019
public safety officer Pete
Maupin rushes to the scene

109
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,300
it's hot

110
00:08:21,861 --> 00:08:23,461
I mean it's very hot

111
00:08:25,501 --> 00:08:26,501
there were explosives

112
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:32,144
can we save anybody?

113
00:08:32,498 --> 00:08:34,298
that was what I was
thinking when I saw this

114
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,340
fall apart

115
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:55,399
49 people are dead after the
tragic take off of comair flight 5191

116
00:08:57,341 --> 00:08:59,951
first officer Polehinke
is the only survivor

117
00:09:02,786 --> 00:09:04,586
first responders, quick actions

118
00:09:04,707 --> 00:09:07,767
were the reason that first officer
Polehinke survived this accident

119
00:09:08,392 --> 00:09:11,592
he was so dramatically
injured that they recognized

120
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,740
that time was of the essence

121
00:09:14,025 --> 00:09:16,967
and transported him to the
hospital out of waiting for ambulance

122
00:09:18,785 --> 00:09:20,985
he back me for saving his life

123
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:23,627
I told him that was my job

124
00:09:23,703 --> 00:09:24,703
but I was glad

125
00:09:30,385 --> 00:09:33,145
the question NTSB
investigators now need to answer

126
00:09:34,021 --> 00:09:37,702
is why comair flight 5191
couldn't get up the ground?

127
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:47,831
as soon as the fires are put
out and the crash site is safe

128
00:09:48,384 --> 00:09:51,184
NTSB investigators
begin looking for clues

129
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:55,240
to discover why comair
flight 5191 crashed

130
00:09:55,265 --> 00:09:58,165
less than a half a mile from
Lexington Blue Grass Airport

131
00:10:00,346 --> 00:10:01,746
make sure every
scrap is documented

132
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:05,023
we need a clear picture the
path this plane took before impact

133
00:10:07,943 --> 00:10:11,625
lead investigator Joe Sedor is among
the first who arrived at the crash site

134
00:10:12,386 --> 00:10:14,386
in this case it was
quite interesting because

135
00:10:14,946 --> 00:10:16,946
initially we didn't have much

136
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,040
an airplane crashed

137
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:21,785
we didn't know it was on the airport
off the airport

138
00:10:23,985 --> 00:10:26,584
we actually started at the final
resting place for the wreckage

139
00:10:27,345 --> 00:10:29,745
and then we walk
back towards the airport

140
00:10:31,023 --> 00:10:32,663
first impact point is there

141
00:10:44,205 --> 00:10:46,205
and the plane hit
those trees over there

142
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,725
is impact marks more
than 20 feet up those trunks

143
00:11:00,343 --> 00:11:02,843
we were looking at the
trajectory of the airplane

144
00:11:03,942 --> 00:11:06,704
clearly looked like it took off
just about end of the runway

145
00:11:07,309 --> 00:11:11,442
and immediately started contacting
trees into the wreckage site

146
00:11:20,228 --> 00:11:21,328
the wreckage path

147
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,597
tells investigators that the plane
was struggling to get off the grounds

148
00:11:24,982 --> 00:11:27,365
was it engine trouble?
or something else

149
00:11:28,103 --> 00:11:30,203
looks like it took
off from runway 26

150
00:11:35,424 --> 00:11:36,424
hang on

151
00:11:40,306 --> 00:11:41,806
26 wasn't in use last night

152
00:11:45,941 --> 00:11:47,941
Lexington airport
has two runways

153
00:11:48,487 --> 00:11:49,487
runway 26

154
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:51,419
and runway 22

155
00:11:54,187 --> 00:11:57,043
according to flight plan there were
supposed to take off from runway 22

156
00:11:59,543 --> 00:12:01,585
so how the heck did
they end up over here?

157
00:12:03,624 --> 00:12:07,624
investigators are surprised
to discover that flight 5191

158
00:12:07,821 --> 00:12:09,821
took off from the wrong runway

159
00:12:10,067 --> 00:12:13,099
well at that point done because we
knew that it was a wrong runway take off

160
00:12:13,179 --> 00:12:14,179
the question is why?

161
00:12:14,862 --> 00:12:16,862
and it's wondered
that doesn’t make sense

162
00:12:18,546 --> 00:12:20,546
did they misunderstand
their instructions?

163
00:12:21,344 --> 00:12:24,944
or deliberately change their plan
to take off from a different runway

164
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:28,704
it's gotta be something on that CVR
about why they were on runway 26

165
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,310
get those to Washington

166
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,560
the flight recorder and
the cockpit voice recorder

167
00:12:36,982 --> 00:12:39,744
were retrieved and flown
back here to Washington DC

168
00:12:41,505 --> 00:12:43,205
but being on the wrong runway

169
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:46,942
doesn't explain why the plane
barely made it off the ground

170
00:12:51,385 --> 00:12:53,885
let's take a closer
look at those engines

171
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,340
when the engines are examined

172
00:12:57,342 --> 00:12:59,942
what the investigator
is looking for is damage

173
00:13:01,868 --> 00:13:04,868
the more damage if there is and
the type of damage tells us that

174
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,663
if it was turning at high speed
or turning at lower speed

175
00:13:10,945 --> 00:13:12,845
they were seining all right

176
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:16,984
evidence of deformed blades suggests
the engines were running on impact

177
00:13:17,822 --> 00:13:21,922
all the indications were that both
engines were operating at high power

178
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,700
when the breakup
sequence started

179
00:13:23,745 --> 00:13:25,445
there is no problem
with the engines

180
00:13:32,702 --> 00:13:35,402
something else must have
kept them from getting airborne

181
00:13:37,464 --> 00:13:38,964
maybe they were too heavy

182
00:13:40,026 --> 00:13:42,026
with engine failure ruled out

183
00:13:42,306 --> 00:13:46,588
the team wonders if the plane was
loaded with too much weight to take off

184
00:13:47,622 --> 00:13:50,988
there is a certain maximum weight
that the aircraft can take off safely with

185
00:13:51,426 --> 00:13:52,485
so what we do is

186
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:56,284
we calculate the load that's on
the aircraft at the time of the accident

187
00:14:02,103 --> 00:14:03,103
here it is

188
00:14:03,664 --> 00:14:05,264
CRJ's max take off weight

189
00:14:05,385 --> 00:14:07,985
is 50,178 pounds

190
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,260
the load manifested
the plane weight

191
00:14:17,425 --> 00:14:21,921
49,087 pounds on that day

192
00:14:23,983 --> 00:14:25,883
it's close but it's
within their limit

193
00:14:26,787 --> 00:14:29,287
the aircraft wasn't
too heavy to take off

194
00:14:30,427 --> 00:14:32,227
and that aircraft on that day

195
00:14:32,702 --> 00:14:35,783
with that weight how much runway
would be needed to take off safely?

196
00:14:37,222 --> 00:14:39,422
using the actual
weight of the aircraft

197
00:14:39,748 --> 00:14:41,548
and the CRJ 100 specifications

198
00:14:42,547 --> 00:14:46,581
investigators calculate how much
runway the plane needed to lift off

199
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:48,421
the weight of the aircraft

200
00:14:48,464 --> 00:14:51,504
affects how fast they have
to be going to be able to lift off

201
00:14:51,547 --> 00:14:53,047
and that is a
directly correlated to

202
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:56,310
how much runway it takes to
be able to achieve that speed

203
00:14:58,262 --> 00:15:04,262
3744 feet

204
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,319
and runway 26 is

205
00:15:08,623 --> 00:15:11,023
3501 feet

206
00:15:13,902 --> 00:15:16,902
investigators reach an
astonishing conclusion

207
00:15:18,107 --> 00:15:20,607
runway 26 is 243 feet short

208
00:15:22,662 --> 00:15:23,662
they ran out of runway

209
00:15:26,064 --> 00:15:29,305
they now understand why
the plane couldn't get airborne

210
00:15:30,587 --> 00:15:32,087
but they're still mystified

211
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:35,780
why didn't flight 5191 take
off from the longer runway?

212
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:49,963
hate to say this but you're not gonna get
any answers from the first officer either

213
00:15:50,105 --> 00:15:52,105
his injures are very severe

214
00:15:54,061 --> 00:15:57,762
the first officer is medically
unfit to be interviewed

215
00:15:58,303 --> 00:16:00,303
it's a big lost to
the investigation

216
00:16:01,705 --> 00:16:03,200
it can be frustrating

217
00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:07,023
when you're not able to speak with
people you'd like to speak with, but

218
00:16:07,062 --> 00:16:10,662
as investigators we need to
work with the data that we have

219
00:16:11,858 --> 00:16:14,578
investigators look for
other clues that might reveal

220
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:19,041
why flight 5191 ended up on the
runway they were not clear to use

221
00:16:21,378 --> 00:16:22,378
they

222
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:24,659
left the gate here

223
00:16:25,022 --> 00:16:26,622
they taxi along here

224
00:16:28,705 --> 00:16:31,722
they're supposed to
leave the runway 22 here

225
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:37,341
but they end up
here

226
00:16:38,785 --> 00:16:40,385
the question is why?

227
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,480
so when we're looking
and trying to understand

228
00:16:43,501 --> 00:16:45,765
why this flight crew thought
they are on runway 22

229
00:16:45,782 --> 00:16:47,982
we looked at anything
that was different

230
00:16:48,058 --> 00:16:50,258
anything that the flight crew
may have misunderstood

231
00:16:50,622 --> 00:16:54,023
with regard to both
the airport and the charts

232
00:16:54,303 --> 00:16:55,903
or any of their training

233
00:16:56,825 --> 00:16:58,105
hey look at this

234
00:16:58,168 --> 00:17:00,168
our guys got some
shuts to the runway

235
00:17:08,665 --> 00:17:10,165
hey check this out

236
00:17:13,461 --> 00:17:14,961
taxi way to runway 22

237
00:17:15,742 --> 00:17:17,742
is blocked up by construction

238
00:17:18,531 --> 00:17:20,141
there were numerous
construction projects

239
00:17:20,201 --> 00:17:24,298
that were in place with the Lexington
airport the day of the accident

240
00:17:24,783 --> 00:17:26,783
okay sure
was that in the chart?

241
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,260
normally when a
taxi way is closed

242
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:34,664
pilots received an interim
airport chart with an alternate route

243
00:17:37,426 --> 00:17:38,926
no nothing on the chart

244
00:17:41,941 --> 00:17:43,941
investigators are
amazed to learn

245
00:17:43,942 --> 00:17:48,742
that the crew's airport chart only
showed the taxi route before construction

246
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,583
not the updated taxi route

247
00:17:55,462 --> 00:17:58,462
it's a surprise to see if
the airport construction

248
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:02,321
had not been updated in the
charts that the flight crew had

249
00:18:04,182 --> 00:18:05,582
it's a disturbing find

250
00:18:06,183 --> 00:18:11,083
could out of date taxi charts have misled
the pilots into taking off from a runway

251
00:18:11,128 --> 00:18:14,096
that was too short
for their plane?

252
00:18:18,502 --> 00:18:21,223
so they get down there
they find their taxi way is blocked

253
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,340
they don't have anything to
tell them how to get to runway 22

254
00:18:25,822 --> 00:18:26,822
that could trick you up

255
00:18:29,227 --> 00:18:31,227
but something doesn't add up

256
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,620
comair flight 5191

257
00:18:34,622 --> 00:18:37,540
wasn't the only plane
departing Lexington that morning

258
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:41,462
other planes left before them and
none of them ended up on runway 26

259
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,240
eagle flight runway 22

260
00:18:46,982 --> 00:18:48,382
clear for take off

261
00:18:51,504 --> 00:18:54,518
the other two flights
took off prior to 5191

262
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,781
and receive the same information
that the flight from 5191 received

263
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:02,360
and did not have any difficulties
and navigating to the runway

264
00:19:03,384 --> 00:19:07,584
the fact that two other aircraft were
able to depart successfully that morning

265
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,900
cause us to look deeper

266
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:19,423
maybe there is something
on the security footage

267
00:19:19,823 --> 00:19:22,423
investigators turn their
attention to CCTV footage

268
00:19:23,506 --> 00:19:28,901
in the hopes that it will explain why
comair 5191 took off from the wrong runway

269
00:19:42,706 --> 00:19:46,806
we were able to retrieve security footage
from cameras on the parking garage

270
00:19:46,821 --> 00:19:49,321
that showed our aircraft
taxing out that morning

271
00:19:50,924 --> 00:19:51,924
all right

272
00:19:51,945 --> 00:19:54,212
let's see what they
were actually up to

273
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:58,161
investigators quickly confirmed
how straight forward the taxi route was

274
00:20:00,103 --> 00:20:02,605
taxi short
there is no other aircraft inside

275
00:20:04,901 --> 00:20:07,901
our assessment based on
examination of surveillance video showed

276
00:20:08,258 --> 00:20:09,991
that it was a nominal taxi

277
00:20:13,342 --> 00:20:17,538
the taxi route from
the ramp to runway 22

278
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:22,281
was straight forward and only
required one runway crossing 26

279
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:25,291
wait stop right there

280
00:20:30,783 --> 00:20:34,946
it looks like they stop then they
hold short line for the runway 26

281
00:20:39,743 --> 00:20:43,265
before take off plane stopped
or hold short of the runway

282
00:20:43,611 --> 00:20:46,660
until they're clear to
proceed by air traffic control

283
00:20:46,862 --> 00:20:50,222
they were on their way to runway 22
why the heck would they stopped there?

284
00:20:51,338 --> 00:20:53,338
investigators are
startled by the discovery

285
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:58,580
we noticed at that time that the
aircraft had stopped prior to runway 26

286
00:21:00,381 --> 00:21:02,381
for over 50 seconds

287
00:21:02,663 --> 00:21:05,998
this is unusual because there is
no real reason for them to stop there

288
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,560
we need to see the taxi route

289
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:11,302
all right

290
00:21:11,584 --> 00:21:15,505
were there clues telling the
pilots they were in the wrong place

291
00:21:15,827 --> 00:21:18,227
one of our main
questions when we realized

292
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:22,164
that they stopped 50 seconds at
the hold short-line for runway 26 was

293
00:21:22,262 --> 00:21:24,262
what could they
have been seeing?

294
00:21:25,627 --> 00:21:29,527
to better understand why
the pilots of comair flight 5191

295
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,844
stopped at the hold short
line for the wrong runway

296
00:21:32,944 --> 00:21:33,944
all right

297
00:21:34,219 --> 00:21:35,579
let's get started

298
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,761
investigators
retrace their taxi route

299
00:21:43,179 --> 00:21:45,601
we want to understand what
the flight crew was seeing

300
00:21:46,021 --> 00:21:49,480
in order to do that we had
to do a taxi demonstration

301
00:21:49,981 --> 00:21:52,281
to identify all the signage

302
00:21:52,522 --> 00:21:55,543
the markings and the cues
available to the flight crew

303
00:22:02,061 --> 00:22:03,061
here on the left

304
00:22:03,746 --> 00:22:05,746
there is a sign for runway 26

305
00:22:10,421 --> 00:22:11,421
straight ahead

306
00:22:11,823 --> 00:22:13,914
I can see the whole
short line for runway 26

307
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:15,339
I mean it's clear as day

308
00:22:18,301 --> 00:22:22,401
things that we were looking for
during that taxi demo were things like

309
00:22:22,539 --> 00:22:25,702
the quality of the
markings on the taxi way

310
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:27,221
the signage

311
00:22:27,283 --> 00:22:29,283
whether was illuminated or not

312
00:22:29,484 --> 00:22:31,484
the taxi line splits three ways

313
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,700
investigators can see what
the pilots would have seen

314
00:22:34,861 --> 00:22:37,194
from the whole
short line for runway 26

315
00:22:37,624 --> 00:22:39,724
the line on the left
goes to runway 26

316
00:22:44,382 --> 00:22:47,382
the line in the middle
is the route to runway 22

317
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,883
the line on the right is
runway 20’s old taxi route

318
00:22:55,945 --> 00:22:57,445
blocked by barricades

319
00:22:59,028 --> 00:23:00,928
I can clearly see
the signs telling us

320
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:03,911
that there we're at the
hold short line for runway 26

321
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,140
I mean it's hard to miss that

322
00:23:08,664 --> 00:23:11,864
investigators discover
that the crew had clear cues

323
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:14,964
that they were at hold
short line for runway 26

324
00:23:15,942 --> 00:23:17,942
not 22

325
00:23:18,219 --> 00:23:21,101
the question remains how
did they miss those cues?

326
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:25,708
okay let's go to 26

327
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:32,839
the test plane follows the
line on the left to runway 26

328
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,220
okay see

329
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:37,781
that's where they should
have taken the taxiway

330
00:23:37,782 --> 00:23:40,726
and stopped the whole
short line for runway 22

331
00:23:43,148 --> 00:23:44,748
investigators are
surprised to learn

332
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:49,356
that even as flight 5191
was turning onto runway 26

333
00:23:49,823 --> 00:23:52,123
the crew had a
clear view of the sign

334
00:23:52,304 --> 00:23:55,312
pointing to the runway
they were meant to be on

335
00:23:55,420 --> 00:24:01,344
there were no features in the environment
in terms of the signs, marking, or lighting

336
00:24:02,184 --> 00:24:04,684
that showed they
were on runway 22

337
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,520
all the cues are right there

338
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:12,183
plane site

339
00:24:13,258 --> 00:24:16,258
Joe Sedor then uncovers
one more disturbing fact

340
00:24:17,142 --> 00:24:21,704
when we taxied from the taxiway
onto and turned onto runway 26

341
00:24:22,219 --> 00:24:26,461
all of the lights on runway 26 were
out and there is no lights in the distance

342
00:24:29,544 --> 00:24:32,444
as an experienced pilot
I look at that and say

343
00:24:32,819 --> 00:24:35,521
why did this flight crew
take off from this runway?

344
00:24:37,062 --> 00:24:39,142
we need to know what
was going on in that cockpit

345
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,140
that is weird with no lights

346
00:24:47,501 --> 00:24:48,501
yeah

347
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:57,782
the cockpit voice recorder from comair
flight 5991 is finally ready to be reviewed

348
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:01,465
okay let's hear what we've got

349
00:25:03,188 --> 00:25:05,282
it maybe the only
hope of explaining

350
00:25:05,429 --> 00:25:08,501
why the crew ended up
on an out of service runway

351
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,184
instead of the one
they were clear to use

352
00:25:11,947 --> 00:25:14,147
in this type of human
factor's accident

353
00:25:14,168 --> 00:25:18,948
it's very difficult because we have to try
to determine what the pilots were thinking

354
00:25:20,623 --> 00:25:23,225
the main tools that we use
in order to determine that

355
00:25:23,467 --> 00:25:25,467
is the cockpit voice recorder

356
00:25:25,666 --> 00:25:29,406
the CVR was very important in understanding
what the flight crew was talking about

357
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:32,662
and what they were doing
during the taxi and the take off

358
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,440
you up for flying this leg?
I'll take us to Atlanta

359
00:25:37,782 --> 00:25:40,782
okay so the first officer is going to fly
that's standard stuff

360
00:25:43,663 --> 00:25:46,944
the flight crew were conducting
themselves in a professional manner

361
00:25:48,139 --> 00:25:50,880
ground briefing, comair standard,
run the checklist at your leisure

362
00:25:50,941 --> 00:25:53,341
keep me out of trouble
I'll do the same thing for you

363
00:25:53,743 --> 00:25:54,743
I'll do the same

364
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:56,818
whenever you're ready

365
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,940
okay here comes the taxi brief

366
00:26:00,742 --> 00:26:04,042
takeoff procedure off
said what runway? 24

367
00:26:05,468 --> 00:26:06,468
it's 22

368
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:08,699
the ILS is out on 22

369
00:26:09,662 --> 00:26:12,741
the other night, the runway identifier
lights were out all over the place

370
00:26:13,024 --> 00:26:14,024
all right

371
00:26:15,266 --> 00:26:17,266
22 is short taxi
any questions?

372
00:26:17,459 --> 00:26:19,460
no question before
starting at your leisure

373
00:26:19,942 --> 00:26:22,302
something in the briefing
surprises investigators

374
00:26:22,743 --> 00:26:24,243
stop it right there

375
00:26:25,545 --> 00:26:28,045
is that not a short brief to you?

376
00:26:31,102 --> 00:26:34,464
they discover that the crew used an
abbreviated version of the taxi brief

377
00:26:35,266 --> 00:26:36,266
called comair standard

378
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:41,260
pull up the comair
standard taxi route

379
00:26:52,263 --> 00:26:54,963
the is no mention of
of crossing runways

380
00:26:55,066 --> 00:26:57,698
or stopping to call ATC if
they're unsure where they are

381
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:01,502
investigators are baffled to discover
that even the shortened taxi brief

382
00:27:02,063 --> 00:27:05,163
with 8 checklist items
including a very crucial one

383
00:27:05,979 --> 00:27:06,979
wasn't followed

384
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,801
they never brief on the
runway they had to cross

385
00:27:09,903 --> 00:27:10,903
to get to runway 22

386
00:27:12,144 --> 00:27:14,544
the crew's abbreviated
briefing that morning

387
00:27:14,619 --> 00:27:18,971
was a deviation from standard
operating procedure that we identified

388
00:27:19,382 --> 00:27:21,682
had the crew done
a full taxi briefing

389
00:27:21,904 --> 00:27:26,448
they would have discussed the need
to cross runway 26 on the way to 22

390
00:27:26,942 --> 00:27:30,363
they missed an opportunity
to review the airport diagram

391
00:27:31,144 --> 00:27:33,699
and determine that they
need to cross runway 26

392
00:27:33,721 --> 00:27:36,421
an intervening runway
before they reach runway 22

393
00:27:39,664 --> 00:27:41,664
let's see their taxi checklist

394
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,060
flight controls

395
00:27:44,822 --> 00:27:46,703
check left and the right trims

396
00:27:48,184 --> 00:27:49,684
engage 07.2

397
00:27:50,979 --> 00:27:53,079
radar terrain displaced
taxi checklist completed

398
00:27:53,782 --> 00:27:56,782
finish up the before takeoff
checklist at your leisure

399
00:27:57,143 --> 00:28:01,143
one other thing on the CVR we
heard was the captain using the term

400
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,340
at your leisure

401
00:28:02,741 --> 00:28:04,641
it was used so many
time on the CVR

402
00:28:04,702 --> 00:28:07,344
what this told us is that
this flight crew was relaxed

403
00:28:07,544 --> 00:28:09,620
maybe they were a
little bit too relaxed

404
00:28:10,581 --> 00:28:11,981
yeah I know 3 guys at Kennedy

405
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:12,981
actually two guys

406
00:28:13,382 --> 00:28:15,284
one went but he did
get through the same

407
00:28:15,324 --> 00:28:16,324
oh really

408
00:28:16,464 --> 00:28:19,364
then a first officer from Cincinnati
he got through the second part and

409
00:28:19,461 --> 00:28:20,461
that's as far as they got

410
00:28:20,941 --> 00:28:22,541
can you stop it right there

411
00:28:22,622 --> 00:28:24,904
investigators cannot
believe what they're hearing

412
00:28:25,124 --> 00:28:27,144
what the heck is
he talking about?

413
00:28:27,411 --> 00:28:29,311
instead of focusing
on their checklist

414
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:34,144
the crew of 5191 were having a casual
conversation during a critical moment

415
00:28:36,106 --> 00:28:39,160
it's a major breach of what's
called the sterile cockpit rule

416
00:28:39,981 --> 00:28:44,081
the sterile cockpit rule requires
that pilots were refrain from

417
00:28:44,184 --> 00:28:48,584
non-operational conversation
during significant portions of flight

418
00:28:48,886 --> 00:28:51,139
one of the key reasons
for the sterile cockpit rules is

419
00:28:51,201 --> 00:28:54,201
that non pertinent
conversation can be distracting

420
00:28:55,423 --> 00:28:56,423
that's as far as they got

421
00:28:57,665 --> 00:28:59,765
and then he actually
got off the position

422
00:28:59,939 --> 00:29:01,939
did he take it? yeah he took it

423
00:29:02,261 --> 00:29:03,261
oh okay

424
00:29:03,301 --> 00:29:06,263
the captain should be shutting his
conversation down not encouraging it

425
00:29:07,784 --> 00:29:10,984
although the first officer
started the conversation

426
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,501
the captain is responsible
for assuring that

427
00:29:14,501 --> 00:29:16,783
sterile cockpit rules and
enforced and distractions

428
00:29:17,304 --> 00:29:20,363
do not enter the cockpit that
could affect the safety of flight

429
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:24,539
after 40 seconds of
casual conversation

430
00:29:24,901 --> 00:29:26,401
second engine started

431
00:29:26,867 --> 00:29:28,867
anti ice probes
windshield low

432
00:29:30,501 --> 00:29:34,542
investigators hear the pilots
turned to their take off checklist

433
00:29:36,665 --> 00:29:38,665
now they finally
get back to the jobs

434
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,180
we're surprised by that

435
00:29:40,581 --> 00:29:42,481
that non pertinent conversation

436
00:29:42,544 --> 00:29:47,299
was in a critical area when the flight
crew is making their taxi out to the runway

437
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:52,062
where the flight crew needs to
be 100 percent flying the aircraft

438
00:29:56,507 --> 00:29:58,507
could that period of inattention

439
00:29:58,508 --> 00:30:00,723
hold a key to this
tragic accident?

440
00:30:04,902 --> 00:30:06,923
okay let's see what
we've got so far

441
00:30:08,544 --> 00:30:11,626
investigators wonder if
a causal conversation is

442
00:30:11,667 --> 00:30:14,675
at the heart of the crash
of Comair Flight 5191

443
00:30:16,422 --> 00:30:18,422
we skipped out of their briefing

444
00:30:18,423 --> 00:30:21,468
and would have told them
they needed to cross 26

445
00:30:21,505 --> 00:30:23,005
to get to 22

446
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:28,050
then for almost a minute

447
00:30:28,499 --> 00:30:30,499
they violate the
sterile cockpit rule

448
00:30:33,624 --> 00:30:35,659
let's see what happens
when they get here

449
00:30:38,381 --> 00:30:41,081
investigators hope the
crew will give some indication

450
00:30:41,224 --> 00:30:44,424
why they stopped at the
hold shortline for runway 26

451
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,980
thrust reverses are armed

452
00:30:48,502 --> 00:30:50,102
auto cross flow is manual

453
00:30:51,025 --> 00:30:52,525
ignition is off

454
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,040
altimeters are 3000

455
00:30:56,061 --> 00:30:58,061
cross the board
cross checked

456
00:30:58,864 --> 00:31:00,864
I'll check in with the cabin

457
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,260
that's it

458
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:07,580
it was surprising to us that
there was no conversation

459
00:31:07,867 --> 00:31:10,267
about their location
on the airfield

460
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,120
or confusion about it

461
00:31:12,582 --> 00:31:15,082
while they were holding
short on runway 26

462
00:31:17,899 --> 00:31:19,899
we know they were distracted

463
00:31:20,701 --> 00:31:22,521
and when they
stop their chit chat

464
00:31:22,667 --> 00:31:25,742
they don't seem to recognize
know or check where they are

465
00:31:28,823 --> 00:31:32,323
we got no information base on
the conversation of the flight crew

466
00:31:32,459 --> 00:31:35,459
while they're holding short
that they were disoriented

467
00:31:35,541 --> 00:31:36,541
no indications at all

468
00:31:38,034 --> 00:31:40,800
investigators are amazed
by what they hear next

469
00:31:41,621 --> 00:31:43,121
at your leisure comair 121
ready to go

470
00:31:44,988 --> 00:31:47,088
comair 191
Lexington tower

471
00:31:50,622 --> 00:31:52,322
fly runway heading
clear for take off

472
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,580
hold there

473
00:31:56,542 --> 00:31:58,475
so they're completely relaxed

474
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:00,483
when they asked for clearance

475
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,724
in fact so relaxed
that they're distracted

476
00:32:02,806 --> 00:32:06,070
that the first officer uses
the wrong flight number

477
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,120
investigators
realized the grim truth

478
00:32:09,182 --> 00:32:13,106
these guys actually thought
they were lined up for runway 22

479
00:32:14,226 --> 00:32:16,308
the fact that they
stopped at runway 26

480
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,381
and subsequently
called for take off

481
00:32:19,821 --> 00:32:25,100
indicates that they lost awareness
that they had not crossed runway 26

482
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,520
they turn onto runway 26

483
00:32:29,022 --> 00:32:30,022
then what

484
00:32:30,704 --> 00:32:31,704
keep going

485
00:32:32,385 --> 00:32:33,385
final checks completed

486
00:32:35,419 --> 00:32:36,419
all yours James

487
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,260
first officer takes the controls

488
00:32:39,061 --> 00:32:40,061
so he's looking at

489
00:32:41,583 --> 00:32:43,183
probably for the first time

490
00:32:44,945 --> 00:32:46,545
at this time the captain

491
00:32:46,946 --> 00:32:48,946
taxied the aircraft
out onto the runway

492
00:32:49,419 --> 00:32:52,561
transport controls
to the first officer

493
00:32:53,103 --> 00:32:55,603
so before this
time the first officer

494
00:32:55,905 --> 00:32:57,505
was heads down in the cockpit

495
00:32:58,701 --> 00:33:00,401
my breaks
my controls

496
00:33:01,502 --> 00:33:03,604
when the first officer
looked out he saw a runway

497
00:33:04,024 --> 00:33:08,119
but he may not have perceived
that it was a narrower runway than

498
00:33:08,461 --> 00:33:09,461
runway 22

499
00:33:11,243 --> 00:33:13,243
they're looking down runway 26

500
00:33:15,144 --> 00:33:17,740
why don't they see the
sign for 22 off to the right?

501
00:33:21,263 --> 00:33:24,905
neither pilot cross checked their location
at the time that they took for runway

502
00:33:31,623 --> 00:33:32,623
set thrust point

503
00:33:34,985 --> 00:33:35,985
thrust set

504
00:33:47,065 --> 00:33:49,065
that is weird with no lights

505
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:50,860
yeah

506
00:33:54,064 --> 00:33:55,064
hold on

507
00:33:56,865 --> 00:33:59,365
runway 26 is not
in use, so it's not lit

508
00:34:01,101 --> 00:34:04,101
they see the lights
for 22 until they cross it

509
00:34:09,821 --> 00:34:11,821
they're looking down
pitched dark runway

510
00:34:12,663 --> 00:34:14,163
and it doesn't faze them

511
00:34:15,195 --> 00:34:17,895
investigators wonder if the
pilots were confused about

512
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,620
what the runway
should have looked like

513
00:34:21,103 --> 00:34:24,803
when they began the
take off roll on runway 26

514
00:34:24,985 --> 00:34:28,186
they had no centerline lights
or edge lights on this runway

515
00:34:28,661 --> 00:34:31,783
however based on the first officer's
previous experience the night before

516
00:34:33,184 --> 00:34:35,184
he did not expect to see lights

517
00:34:36,548 --> 00:34:37,548
the ILS is out on 22

518
00:34:38,499 --> 00:34:41,721
other night, the runway identifier
lights were out all over the place

519
00:34:42,143 --> 00:34:45,545
so it would not necessarily have
been on an unusual site picture

520
00:34:46,344 --> 00:34:49,844
such decision making based
on a person mistaken assessment

521
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,780
is called confirmation bias

522
00:34:53,063 --> 00:34:57,303
confirmation bias is where the flight
crew expects something to be there

523
00:34:57,501 --> 00:34:59,502
even though it might
not actually to be there

524
00:35:02,024 --> 00:35:04,539
he notice there is no
lights on the runway

525
00:35:05,379 --> 00:35:07,179
but he just accepted the fact

526
00:35:08,184 --> 00:35:09,184
what happened next?

527
00:35:16,588 --> 00:35:17,588
100 knots
checks

528
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:22,703
the pilots now see they're
almost out of runway

529
00:35:22,782 --> 00:35:23,782
rotate

530
00:35:25,185 --> 00:35:27,427
and don't have the
required speed to get airborne

531
00:35:27,989 --> 00:35:28,989
wow

532
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:31,780
damn it

533
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,060
that's it

534
00:35:39,742 --> 00:35:42,743
they finally realize something
is wrong and it's too late

535
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,860
based on our calculation
the crew needed to recognize

536
00:35:48,141 --> 00:35:50,041
that they were on
the wrong runway

537
00:35:50,102 --> 00:35:54,640
and successfully reject the take off
about 20 seconds into the take off roll

538
00:35:55,142 --> 00:35:59,065
however their recognition
did not occur until much later

539
00:35:59,746 --> 00:36:03,020
when the captain called
rotate at the lower speed

540
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,780
than it was required

541
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:15,360
investigators have
unraveled the mystery

542
00:36:15,383 --> 00:36:18,519
of what happened inside
the cockpit of flight 5191

543
00:36:25,462 --> 00:36:27,559
they start out by
skipping the full briefing

544
00:36:28,821 --> 00:36:30,621
then after long
discussion about the airline

545
00:36:30,662 --> 00:36:32,962
they lose sight
about where they are

546
00:36:33,548 --> 00:36:35,448
they stop at the wrong place

547
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,761
and they completely miss all the
signage that they are at the wrong runway

548
00:36:39,142 --> 00:36:41,723
by the time they figure
out the mistake, it's too late

549
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,920
these guys are going
through the motions

550
00:36:44,983 --> 00:36:47,139
when they should have
been of full attention

551
00:36:48,621 --> 00:36:51,821
the crew's failure to use
available cues and aids

552
00:36:51,983 --> 00:36:54,783
to identify and check
the plane's location

553
00:36:56,185 --> 00:36:59,185
let to the tragedy of
comair flight 5191

554
00:37:06,825 --> 00:37:09,847
but the team still has
one unanswered question

555
00:37:10,468 --> 00:37:13,542
why didn't the controller tell them
they were at the wrong runway?

556
00:37:22,982 --> 00:37:27,460
investigators wonder if the air
traffic controller of comair flight 5191

557
00:37:28,019 --> 00:37:30,019
could have picked
up the crew's error

558
00:37:30,262 --> 00:37:32,262
and prevented the accident

559
00:37:33,624 --> 00:37:35,624
happy to answer any questions

560
00:37:35,684 --> 00:37:38,984
with the air traffic controller
we were trying to understand

561
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:43,282
did the controller have an opportunity to
see this airplane take the wrong runway?

562
00:37:43,304 --> 00:37:44,304
and prevent the accident

563
00:37:45,539 --> 00:37:47,539
605 they asked for
take off clearance

564
00:37:48,902 --> 00:37:50,402
runway 22 was

565
00:37:50,583 --> 00:37:52,583
free so I gave comair

566
00:37:53,058 --> 00:37:54,738
clearance for take off

567
00:37:56,421 --> 00:37:58,521
at your leisure comair 121
ready to go

568
00:37:59,223 --> 00:38:00,223
comair 191

569
00:38:01,188 --> 00:38:02,188
Lexington tower

570
00:38:02,588 --> 00:38:04,388
fly runway heading
clear for take off

571
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:07,380
runway heading
clear for take off 191

572
00:38:10,744 --> 00:38:12,444
and what did you do next?

573
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:16,241
I saw the plane proceed
towards runway 26

574
00:38:16,382 --> 00:38:19,939
and then scanned runway 22 to
make sure there were no vehicles on it

575
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,820
did you watch
the flight take off?

576
00:38:22,863 --> 00:38:24,863
not if I have other jobs to do

577
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,880
investigators make
one final discovery

578
00:38:30,143 --> 00:38:32,243
and then I turned over
here to cut my flight strips

579
00:38:33,785 --> 00:38:36,469
and why would you start
cutting your flight strips then?

580
00:38:36,541 --> 00:38:37,541
I wasn't busy

581
00:38:39,618 --> 00:38:41,618
it only takes a few minutes

582
00:38:43,262 --> 00:38:46,323
and there was no reason to
think that they have any problems

583
00:38:46,383 --> 00:38:47,383
17 years

584
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:50,699
I've never seen a plane that
size try to take off from runway 26

585
00:38:53,381 --> 00:38:56,381
the controller was not
watching the airplane

586
00:38:56,466 --> 00:38:59,821
and assumed that the airplane was
going to take off on the correct runway

587
00:39:00,121 --> 00:39:02,121
because this is
such a simple airport

588
00:39:02,382 --> 00:39:04,582
and because there
was no other traffic

589
00:39:04,668 --> 00:39:06,668
on the airport at the
time of the accident

590
00:39:07,783 --> 00:39:09,783
and if you hadn't turned away

591
00:39:10,303 --> 00:39:12,803
would have notice that they
were on the wrong place?

592
00:39:17,061 --> 00:39:18,061
I might have

593
00:39:20,184 --> 00:39:24,239
FAA regulations do not require
controllers to monitor every take off

594
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:29,507
but if the controller had been watching the
runway instead of counting flight strips

595
00:39:29,786 --> 00:39:32,786
he might have notice
flight 5191's mistake

596
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:37,204
he was not actually required
nor or any any controllers required

597
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,820
to actually watch an
aircraft during its take off roll

598
00:39:41,221 --> 00:39:43,221
had they have been
required to do that

599
00:39:43,285 --> 00:39:47,289
this would have given an opportunity
to have the take off aborted

600
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:51,600
the NTSB concludes that
several factors led the pilots

601
00:39:51,785 --> 00:39:55,497
to lose track of their position
on their way to the runway

602
00:39:56,579 --> 00:40:01,944
contributing to that was the flight
crew's failure to maintain sterile cockpit

603
00:40:02,506 --> 00:40:04,148
and have a non
pertinent conversation

604
00:40:04,505 --> 00:40:05,505
prior to take off

605
00:40:06,511 --> 00:40:08,611
this crash happened because of a

606
00:40:09,344 --> 00:40:10,944
period of distraction

607
00:40:11,621 --> 00:40:13,221
during what was perceived

608
00:40:13,346 --> 00:40:15,346
as a relatively simple taxi

609
00:40:16,746 --> 00:40:18,246
and it illustrates

610
00:40:18,747 --> 00:40:20,347
the perils of distraction

611
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:23,252
in that it can take you off task

612
00:40:23,302 --> 00:40:25,269
it can cause you
to lose awareness

613
00:40:25,303 --> 00:40:29,303
and in this case both crew
members lost awareness

614
00:40:29,504 --> 00:40:32,103
of where they were
on that airport surface

615
00:40:32,344 --> 00:40:33,844
and made a mistake

616
00:40:34,063 --> 00:40:35,963
that was extremely consequential

617
00:40:39,102 --> 00:40:41,702
among the NTSB's recommendations

618
00:40:41,785 --> 00:40:45,304
is a basic technological change
to prevent pilots from getting lost

619
00:40:46,587 --> 00:40:50,587
the CRJ100 at the time
had sophisticated avionics

620
00:40:51,104 --> 00:40:55,459
but it lacked a simple GPS system
available in cars of the same era

621
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:00,320
install moving map GPS displays

622
00:41:00,946 --> 00:41:02,546
in CRJ100 cockpits

623
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:08,464
the NTSB also makes
recommendations for flight crews

624
00:41:08,543 --> 00:41:11,623
require pilots to check that
they are at the assigned runway

625
00:41:13,862 --> 00:41:15,362
before crossing
the hold short line

626
00:41:21,466 --> 00:41:23,466
first officer James Polehinke

627
00:41:23,749 --> 00:41:26,349
the lone survivor
of comair flight 5191

628
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,651
suffered severe injuries

629
00:41:29,143 --> 00:41:31,143
including the
lost of his left leg

630
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:34,823
he never return to
commercial aviation

631
00:41:37,861 --> 00:41:39,861
this was a catastrophic accident

632
00:41:41,266 --> 00:41:43,266
it affected scores
and scores of lives

633
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:47,710
but the legacy of this accident

634
00:41:48,063 --> 00:41:51,743
are the safety changes that
have been made to prevent

635
00:41:51,748 --> 00:41:54,884
this type of accident from
happening in the future

636
00:41:56,309 --> 00:42:00,544
this accident shows that there
are threats in any environment

637
00:42:01,382 --> 00:42:03,882
no matter how docile they seem

638
00:42:03,946 --> 00:42:06,346
in that flight crews
have to be aware and

639
00:42:06,499 --> 00:42:09,635
have to be looking for all
the threats at all the time
